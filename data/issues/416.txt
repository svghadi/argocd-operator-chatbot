Update the documentation for build process.
**Describe the bug**
Creating this issue to track the documentation changes w.r.t build process.
Old Docs:
https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/development/#build
https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/master/docs/contribute/development.md

**Expected behavior**
Update the new documentation where build process is made easy by the operator-sdk upgrade.

This issue is partially fixed by #451.

we need to update the below doc.
https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/development/#build
@iam-veeramalla It seems to me like all of the docs have been updated. Is there anything else that you think is still missing?
