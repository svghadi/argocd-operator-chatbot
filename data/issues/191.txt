missing gpg configmap after update argocdoperator 0.0.13 to 0.0.14
Hi. 
  i found same bug reported [here](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/issues/457) after update operator from 0.0.13 to 0.0.14 (argocd version from 1.6.2 to 1.7.7).

I Resolved issue apply a suggested workaround, create missing cm in argocd namespace 

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: argocd-gpg-keys-cm
  namespace: argocd
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-gpg-keys-cm
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: argocd
```
bye

This is fixed by #193, released with v0.0.15
