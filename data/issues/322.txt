Version 0.0.15 update now getting Dex failure
**Describe the bug**
Operator was auto updated to 0.0.015 and now the DEX server will not start

error:
In DEX container log:
Error: unknown command "rundex" for "argocd-util"
Run 'argocd-util --help' for usage.
unknown command "rundex" for "argocd-util"

**To Reproduce**
upgrade to 0.0.15 in Openshift 4.7, DEX server does not start

**Expected behavior**
Dex server should start


**Additional context**
Had no issues with this in 0.0.14 using Openshift 4.7



Were are currently seeing this as well.
Problem here too. How can I downgrade operator?
See: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/5306
and: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/docs/operator-manual/upgrading/1.8-2.0.md#dex-tool-migrated-from-argocd-util-to-argocd-dex 
This is fixed with #270 in code, I guess... Did not make it into the package. @jomkz
I have this work around until next fix:  https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/5306
Same behaviour on our OpenShift 4.7 and the work around described above fixed it for now, https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/5306. Thats is change the lines in "-command"'s like this:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: argocd-dex-server
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - command:
            - /shared/argocd-dex
            - rundex
          name: dex
      initContainers:
        - command:
            - cp
            - -n
            - /usr/local/bin/argocd-dex
            - /shared
          name: copyutil
Hi @u849296 , Thanks for raising the issue with us :)

We got this issue fixed as part of #270 but unfortunately it seems to missed during packaging. We are looking into the options of releasing a new version of the operator or documenting the work arounds. I will keep the issue updated with any sort of progress made.
