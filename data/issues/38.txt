ArgoCDExport getting InvalidImageName on pod creation
Hey there!

First of all thank you for all the hard work on the operator!

I'm having problems with the ArgoCDExport on v0.0.5. I'm on Openshift 4.3 on aws.

The operator creates the PVC and the Job, but I'm getting an error on the pod creation.

I get `Error: InvalidImageName` error and upon further debugging I get:
```
Failed to apply default image tag "argoproj/argocd:sha256:f7a4a8e4542ef9d2e0cb6d3fe5814e87b79b8064089c0bc29ae7cefae8e93b66": couldn't parse image reference "argoproj/argocd:sha256:f7a4a8e4542ef9d2e0cb6d3fe5814e87b79b8064089c0bc29ae7cefae8e93b66": invalid reference format
```
I've tried pulling v1.4.2 instead, but I then get `/bin/bash: /backups/argocd-backup.yaml: Permission denied`

Any ideia what it could be?

Thanks!

Thanks for your feedback @RicardoDMAraujo.

Unfortunately it looks like a bug with the operator in the export logic with how image tags are handled. That was changed recently to support disconnected installs, hence the SHA digest you see. I may have missed something in the export job with regard to that, so I will investigate. The othere problem here is that I have the image and tag hard-coded so-to-speak in the export logic, so there is no good way to change the image tag. That needs to be fixed.

This is good timing because I am going to begin working on support for AWS buckets as a storage location for the backups here soon. I will fix this as part of that. I want to roll out v0.0.6 next week at the latest.

Would be interested in any feedback you may have.  
Working on this in the [export_img](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/tree/export_img) branch.
Merged into master, will go out in v0.0.6
Released as part of v0.0.6.
