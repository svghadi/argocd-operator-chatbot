Add possibility to change haproxy image
Hello,

it seems, that you can change all images via the ArgoCD CRD except for the redis haproxy image, which is unfortunate in a disconnected environment.
Is it possible to add support for this?
Hey @ccdgrundhoefer, thanks for trying the operator. This can be added, sorry for the oversight on that image
Merged into master and will go out in v0.0.13
