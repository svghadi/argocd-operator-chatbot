Docs Need Update
The docs need to be updated to integrate better with [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.io).
I have updated the docs to use the same theme as Argo CD itself and the results are pretty good. 

https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

This is a good start but more work is needed for documenting all aspects of the operator.
