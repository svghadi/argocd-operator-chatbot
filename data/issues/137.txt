Enable Routes Not allowed?
Hi,

We have attempted to create a new ArgoCD object using the operator, and when we enable the route on the server we get the following error:

`Error "Invalid value: "boolean": spec.server.route in body must be of type object: "boolean"" for field "spec.server.route".`

The following is an example of ArgoCD Object that we know it worked prior to 0.0.9:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd
  labels:
    app: argocd
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  dex:
    openShiftOAuth: true
  grafana:
    enabled: false
  ha:
    enabled: true
  prometheus:
    enabled: false
  server:
    route: true
  usersAnonymousEnabled: true
```


I have also attempted to enable the route after deployment, however when submitting changes, it is still not working.

This issue started only after 0.0.9 I believe, and I tried it in 11 and 12 same problem.

Any advice?
Hi @AbdulR3hman, thank you for trying the operator. The spec for Routes changed in [v0.0.10](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/releases/tag/v0.0.10), please see the [Routes documentation](https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/argocd/#server-route-options) for the new way to enable Routes.

Using the example you provided, you would use the following:

``` yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd
  labels:
    app: argocd
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  dex:
    openShiftOAuth: true
  grafana:
    enabled: false
  ha:
    enabled: true
  prometheus:
    enabled: false
  server:
    route:
        enabled: true
  usersAnonymousEnabled: true
```
@jmckind Just noticed this as well. Looks like some of the examples in the repo just need updated (https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/master/examples/argocd-oauth.yaml)
The documentation was clarified in #140
