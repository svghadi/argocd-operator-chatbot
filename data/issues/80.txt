Document Kustomize Deployment
We added kustomize to the options for deploying this operator but need to go back and update the documentation to reflect that as well. This is a placeholder to remind me to get that updated.
It would be nice to provide too a single rendered yaml manifest generated from your kustomization, like they do in upstream argocd for manual deployment.

It would help for airgap scenarios when OLM cannot be used or github accessed.
