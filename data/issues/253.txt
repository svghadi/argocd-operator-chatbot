default admin password issue
This issue similar to #62 with another environment
I installed Argocd operator using operatorHub, enabled the openshift authenticator for dex.
I successfully patched the admin.password usin 

```
oc -n argocd patch secret dev-argocd-cluster   -p '{"stringData": { "admin.password": "$2y$10$H89WxK73Qv9kTZhf2O1bteHO/eH5BLb41dGI.QJ5fbRoBcG5/dYt."  }}'
```

after the pod restarted, I am still not able to login with the admin username and password
The error message:

```
argocd login --username admin --insecure dev-argocd-server-argocd.mydomain.com
Password:
FATA[0008] rpc error: code = Unauthenticated desc = Invalid username or password
```

Operator version: argocd-operator.v0.0.14 
Platform: openshift 4
Installation method: OperatorHub
Hi @hhemied The password is (unfortunately) stored unencrypted/unhashed in the secret, that looks like a hashed password?

This is documented here https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/basics/#secrets
Thanks, @bigkevmcd for your kind support.

yes, the password is bcrypted, but I now used the plain text and it worked as expected.
