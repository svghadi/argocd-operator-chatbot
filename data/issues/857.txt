This is a confusing issue. The title change made things more ambiguous.

From my investigation::

For `ApplicationSetController`:
- The docs say `logFormat` is supported, but it doesn't reflect that in the CRD or the controller's code.

For `ApplicationController`:
- The docs don't say `logFormat` is supported, but the CRD and the code seems to reflect support.
