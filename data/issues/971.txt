**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

Currently, Redis can only be deployed using the argocd-operator's own Redis service. In some scenarios where there is already an existing Redis service, we desire to be able to use the existing Redis service.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

1. The redis service could be disabled.
2. The argocd controllers support to be configured with other redis service.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

None

**Additional context**

None
