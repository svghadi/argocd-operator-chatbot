Incompatible with OLM 0.22.0?
**Describe the bug**
Following the instructions on RTD using the 0.4.0 release codebase, I end up being unable to add the catalog:

```
$ kubectl get pods -n olm -l olm.catalogSource=argocd-catalog
NAME                   READY   STATUS             RESTARTS        AGE
argocd-catalog-4z5nk   0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   6 (3m30s ago)   9m20s
```

Checking the logs for the pod, I see:

```
$ kubectl logs -n olm argocd-catalog-4z5nk
Error: open /etc/nsswitch.conf: permission denied
Usage:

```

This looks identical to an issue from 2020: https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/issues/1806

However, since 0.4.0 was cut in July 2022 I would assume it was working at the time.

This is on Docker for Desktop running Kubernetes v1.25.0 on Mac OS X 12.1. 

**To Reproduce**
1. Install OLM
2. Install the catalog source as described in the 0.4.0 release.

**Expected behavior**
It should work.

It looks like this probably would be resolved by just updating the `registry` image to be based off of the OLM v1.26 builder image, since the current base registry image seems wildly out of date.

However I can't get the operator or registry image to build locally on OS X so that's just a guess:
```
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
/Users/shakefu/git/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/bin/setup-envtest use 1.21
unable to find a version that was supported for platform darwin/arm64
make: *** [envtest] Error 2
```
Hello.

As mentioned by @shakefu, we try to use the latest registry version 0.4.0:
quay.io/argoprojlabs/argocd-operator-registry@sha256:a541110c0d2bde77e19643cf191d82937d4ed6e96f3bc2c38d2126f27351cb46
or
quay.io/argoprojlabs/argocd-operator-registry:v0.4.0

and the result remain the same when we deploy the catalog_source :
Error: open /etc/nsswitch.conf: permission denied

Can you update the argocd-operator-registry please?
