RFE: Support for disabling Dex
As ArgoCD works quite well with already existing OIDC providers it would be nice to have the option to completely disable the deployment of the bundled Dex server. 
Thanks for the suggestion @lhw! That is something that I also noticed in the past and meant to come back to fix. 
@iam-veeramalla I believe this can be done with the `DISABLE_DEX` var correct? So I think this issue can be closed.

Thanks @tylerauerbeck  .. true.
Can this be re-opened? The var is not working and we see dex deployed.
