The `url` in argocd-cm is set incorrectly when using an ingress
When an ingress is used, the value of the `url` field in the `argocd-cm` always gets set to the service endpoint (e.g. https://argocd-server) instead of the ingress host. Looking at the code, it appears that when the ingress is created it is named `${cr.Name}` but when the ConfigMap logic looks for the ingress it is looking for `${cr.Name}-server`. Since it doesn't find the ingress it keeps the server url.

To make matters worse, when using the operator you are unable to manually change the value in the configmap because the operator will immediately change it back.

## ArgoCD CSV

`argocd-operator.v0.0.8` 

## CR

```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd
spec:
  server:
    host: argocd-tools.{ingress subdomain}
    ingress: true
    insecure: true
```


Merged #98 to address this, thanks!
