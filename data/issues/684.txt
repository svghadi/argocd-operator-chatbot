Ability to customize UI options
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Not all config options of ArgoCD server (argocd-cm) can be controlled by the operator (or I wasn't able to figure out how).
When running multiple ArgoCD instances I'd like to alter the UI with custom stylesheets in order to better distinguish them in the browser.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Add a section in the ArgoCD operator resource schema where one can control custom styles as documented here:
https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/custom-styles/


Hi @thomascube , Thanks for reaching out.

We have understood the problem that we currently do not support all the config options available for argocd-cm and these config options will keep growing. To fix the problem we have introduced the support for extraConfig in Argo CD CR through which you can add entries to argocd-cm.

This fix is already merged to master and it will be out in the next release `0.4.0` which is planned with in a couple of weeks from now.
Please try this with the new release(once it is released) and feel free to re-open the issue. **I am closing this as a duplicate of** #641 
Perfect. Thanks for the fast response!
