Invalid Image location for ApplicationSets
**Describe the bug**
Operator is not able to create an ApplicationSet pod due to default invalid Image location in the defaults.go 

```
  Warning  Failed          76s (x6 over 3m11s)   kubelet            Error: ImagePullBackOff
  Normal   BackOff         64s (x7 over 3m11s)   kubelet            Back-off pulling image "quay.io/argocdapplicationset/argocd-applicationset:v0.2.0"
```

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run the operator locally using `make install && make run`
2. Create an Argo CD CR with the below configuration.
```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
  namespace: foo
spec:
  applicationSet:
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "2"
        memory: 1Gi
      requests:
        cpu: 250m
        memory: 512Mi
  server:
    route:
      enabled: true
```
3. Verify that the application set pod moves in to `ImagePullBackoff` state.

**Expected behavior**
ApplicationSets pod is in running state.


@iam-veeramalla Ah. Looks like v0.2.0 was released, but never pushed to quay. Any idea who to chat with to get that done?

looks like the images are now pushed to the `argoproj` repository
