Wildcard for objects with resourceCustomizations
Hi,
Dealing with resourceCustomizations is ok for all kind of objects.
In my case, it is for ignoreDifferences.

```
resourceCustomizations: |
  apps/StatefulSet:
    ignoreDifferences: |
      jqPathExpressions:
        - '.metadata.labels."app.kubernetes.io/instance"'
  Service:
    ignoreDifferences: |
      jqPathExpressions:
        - '.metadata.labels."app.kubernetes.io/instance"'
  Pod:
    ignoreDifferences: |
      jqPathExpressions:
        - '.metadata.labels."app.kubernetes.io/instance"'
```

But can i use a wildcard ?
To consider every object with only one declaration in resourceCustomizations parameter ?

Something like :
```
resourceCustomizations: |
  all:
    ignoreDifferences: |
      jqPathExpressions:
        - '.metadata.labels."app.kubernetes.io/instance"'
```
or anything else ?!

It's seem that it's possible, as mentioned here :
