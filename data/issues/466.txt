Pods keep being recreated on clusters when env vars are added.
**Describe the bug**
Building a latest version of the operator from source(master) creates the below issue.

The PR #437 adds a logic to support adding custom environment variables into repo-server, server and controller. While this allows adding the env vars into the workloads, the order of the env vars is not same every-time. This is causing the below reconciliation condition on repo-server to fail(similarly for server and controller as well).
https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/b674bea5d139859ffae5d6b2add03db1975369d2/controllers/argocd/deployment.go#L952

The above reconciliation uses `reflects.DeepEqual` which bothers about the order of the slice.

This issue is most commonly reproduced on clusters which are behind proxy as operator+olm adds the proxy env vars into the workloads. so every-time the order of the env vars is changed a new container/pod is created. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a latest version of the operator from master.
2. Run the operator on a cluster behind proxy or add multiple env vars.

**Expected behavior**
Pods should not be recreated.

**Screenshots**
NA

**Additional context**
