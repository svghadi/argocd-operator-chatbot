resource customization for custom health check using operator not working
**Describe the bug**
ArgoCD instance using the operator is already rolled out successfully.  Attempting to edit the ArgoCD resource to add a custom health check to support OpenShift DeploymentConfigs.

The operator accepts the ReousceCustomization attribute but does not update the requisite argocd-cm configmap for the Argocd resource.

If I attempt to manually edit the argocd-cm resource to add resource.customization in the required format, the operator is removing it after reconciliation.

So, not only is the operator not applying my change to the resource, but also removing the manual change so I am completely unable to apply this custom health check.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Following the operator docs (https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/health/) I added my health check script to the ArgoCD resource:
```
ResourceCustomizations:
    apps.openshift.io/DeploymentConfig:
      health.lua: |
        hs = {}
        if obj.status ~= nil then
          if obj.status.conditions ~= nil then
            for i, condition in ipairs(obj.status.conditions) do
              if condition.type == "Available" and condition.status == "False" then
                hs.status = "Degraded"
                hs.message = condition.message
                return hs
              end
              if condition.type == "Available" and condition.status == "True" then
                hs.status = "Healthy"
                hs.message = condition.message
                return hs
              end
            end
          end
        end
        hs.status = "Progressing"
        hs.message = "Waiting for rollout"
       return hs
```

The argocd-cm resource is never updated after applying this.

I then went to the argocd-cm configmap and manually attempted to put this in place (https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/health/#custom-health-checks):

```
resource.customizations: |
    apps.openshift.io/DeploymentConfig:
      health.lua: |
        hs = {}
        if obj.status ~= nil then
          if obj.status.conditions ~= nil then
            for i, condition in ipairs(obj.status.conditions) do
              if condition.type == "Available" and condition.status == "False" then
                hs.status = "Degraded"
                hs.message = condition.message
                return hs
              end
              if condition.type == "Available" and condition.status == "True" then
                hs.status = "Healthy"
                hs.message = condition.message
                return hs
              end
            end
          end
        end
        hs.status = "Progressing"
        hs.message = "Waiting for rollout"
        return hs
```

After the operator reconciles, this edit is removed from the argocd-cm configmap

**Expected behavior**
Ether the operator applies the ResourceCustomization or let's me manually edit the argocd-cm configmap
