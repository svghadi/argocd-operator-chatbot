Consider listing operator in Artifact Hub
Hi! üëãüèª

Have you considered listing the **argocd** operator directly in [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io)? 

At the moment it is already [listed there](https://artifacthub.io/packages/olm/community-operators/argocd-operator), because the Artifact Hub team has added the [community-operators](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/tree/master/upstream-community-operators) repository. However, listing it yourself directly has some benefits:

- You add your repository *once*, and new versions (or even new operators) committed to your git repository will be indexed *automatically* and listed in Artifact Hub, with no extra PRs needed.
- You can display the [Verified Publisher](https://github.com/artifacthub/hub/blob/master/docs/repositories.md#verified-publisher) label in your operators, [increasing their visibility](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?page=1&verified_publisher=true) and potentially the users' trust in your content.
- Increased visibility of your organization in urls and search results. Users will be able to see your organization's description, a link to the home page and search for other content published by you.
- If something goes wrong indexing your repository, you will be notified and you can even inspect the logs to check what went wrong.

If you decide to go ahead, you just need to sign in and add your repository from the control panel. You can add it using a single user or create an organization for it, whatever suits your needs best.

You can find some notes about the expected repository url format and repository structure in the [repositories guide](https://github.com/artifacthub/hub/blob/master/docs/repositories.md#olm-operators-repositories). There is also available an example of an [operator repository](https://github.com/ctron/ditto-operator/tree/master/olm) already listed in Artifact Hub [in the documentation](https://github.com/artifacthub/hub/blob/master/docs/repositories.md#example-repository-ditto-operator-repository). Operators are expected to be packaged using the [format defined in the Operator Framework documentation](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/blob/master/docs/contributing.md#packaging-format) to facilitate the process.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you encounter any issue during the process üôÇ
Hi @tegioz, thanks for the request! We should hopefully be moving the github project over to the official upstream org soon and once that is done, I think that the operator can be listed as you explained.
Awesome, thanks! üëç 
Looks like this is available on ArtifactHub already: https://artifacthub.io/packages/olm/community-operators/argocd-operator

So this can probably be closed?
