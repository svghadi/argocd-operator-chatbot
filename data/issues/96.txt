When a `host` is provided for the ingress it is not used for the TLS host
When a `host` is provided along with ingress=true then the operator will create an ingress that uses the host value in the `rules` section. However, the TLS section will always use `${cr.Name}` for the TLS host. The result is that the TLS endpoint is not available.

It seems like if the host is provided it should be used in both places within the ingress

## ArgoCD CSV

`argocd-operator.v0.0.8` 

## CR

```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd
spec:
  server:
    host: argocd-tools.{ingress subdomain}
    ingress: true
    insecure: true
```

Merged #97 to address this issue, thanks!
