Request to support manual install with a single YAML file
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
As we can see from the [document]() about how to install Argo CDoperator manually.

```shell
make deploy IMG=quay.io/my-org/argocd-operator:latest
```

Users need to clone the git repository to the local environment. This is not convenient if they just want to install instead of exploring the codebase.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Provide a single YAML file for that. Users can download the YAML from GitHub releaser assets. And install it manually with the following instruction:

```shell
kubectl apply -f argocd-operator.yaml
```

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
None.

**Additional context**
None.

I'd like to help with this. But I didn't find the corresponding GitHub action script file. Please feel free to leave your comment below.
Hi @LinuxSuRen what help are you looking for ? Would you like to create a new action for this ?
