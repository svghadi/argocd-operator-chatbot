DEX support for ArgoCD v2.0+
**Describe the bug**
ArgoCD updated the DEX helper from `argocd-util` to `argocd-dex`. The operator is currently configuring DEX to use the old binary locations/names when ArgoCD 2.0+ is used. See https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/upgrading/1.8-2.0/#dex-tool-migrated-from-argocd-util-to-argocd-dex

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install the operator
2. Add in an instance of ArgoCD using v2.0.1.
3. Dex Pod fails to start

**Expected behavior**
Dex deployment should be configured with the correct command line arguments.

Note: I was able to work around the issue by bootstrapping the installation with an older version of ArgoCD, then updating the `image` and `version` fields in the `ArgoCD` spec. 


Hi @Aenima4six2  This change is already addressed as part of https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/pull/270. This is part of new version 0.0.15.

Hey @iam-veeramalla. Maybe I'm missing something. I'm currently on `0.0.15`.
@Aenima4six2 
Can I know how did you upgrade to 0.0.15? Also can you please share your dex deployment.yml here ? 

Please mask any secure data.

For the upgrade, I removed version `0.0.14` of the operator along with all ArgoCD instances, added the below CatalogSource and installed `0.0.15`

I don't have a `deployment.yaml` for DEX, since the operator sets that up. Here is my redacted ArgoCD config though.
