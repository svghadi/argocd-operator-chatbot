ability to set annotations+labels on pods created by argocd
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Hi, we need to set annotations on any pods running on our cluster, but I can't find the option to do so on pods deployed by argo.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Something like:
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
...
controller:
  podAnnotations:
    some: anno
  labels:
    some: label
...
server:
  podAnnotations:
    ana: da
```
A better question to ask is: Why does the operator not support the exact same options as the helm charts? Istio Operator does the same, as do other operators. It would be trivial and super beneficial
@Morriz I agree it is very useful, but I see a concern with operator reconciling the labels and annotations. There is a good chance that operator may removes annotations/labels set by admission controllers. WDYT ?

That is a matter of having a mature operator that allows for labels it does not manage. That is why one namespaces them, in order to filter.
LGTM. Would you like to work on this one ? If not I can add the label `help-wanted` and remove `traige-required`.

Thanks @Morriz
