Unable to configure Dex to accept auth from Argo Workflows
**Describe the bug**
The docs for configuring Argo Workflows to use Argo CD's Dex instance describe adding an environment variable to the Dex deployment to allow Argo Workflows to authenticate. The argocd-operator doesn't have an option for adding environment variables to the Dex deployment.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Look at the struct for the Dex spec: https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/master/api/v1beta1/argocd_types.go#L183

**Expected behavior**
I'd expect to see a field that will allow the user to add environment variables to the Dex deployment.
