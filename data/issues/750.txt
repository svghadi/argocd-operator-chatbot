operator resources should have unique labels.
**Describe the bug**
The operator deployment and other resources created by `operator-sdk` has the default label `control-plane: controller-manager` without any prefix or suffix. Also, by default all the operators running in `all-namespaces` mode will be installed in `openshift-operators` namespace. So, if the default `labels` and `selectors` are not updated a request from operator service `x` might be sent to operator pod `y`.

One of our downstream users has reported a similar issue when `gitops-runner` operator and `gitlab-operator` are installed on their cluster.
```
I have a customer on xxxx on 4.9.37 who have got these operators installed from the OperatorHub.
Red Hat OpenShift GitOps  -----> 1.5.4 provided by Red Hat Inc.
GitLab Runner ----> 1.9.0 provided by GitLab, Inc.
The target namespace for these operators in "openshift-operators" and cannot be overridden.
The GitLab runner installs  3 services with a pod selector "control-plane=controller-manager".
This pod selector matches pods installed by both operators, hence customer is getting random deployment errors like:
```

```
one or more objects failed to apply, reason: Internal error occurred: 
failed calling webhook "mrunner.kb.io": 
failed to call webhook: Post "[https://gitlab-runner-controller-manager-service.xxxxxxx.com/xxxxxxxxxx-com-v1beta2-runner?timeout=10s](https://gitlab-runner-controller-manager-service.xxxxxx.com/xxxx-xx-gitlab-com-v1beta2-runner?timeout=10s)": 
dial tcp xx:xxx:xx:xx:x443: connect: connection refused
```

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to 'OperatorHub'
2. Install `argocd-operator`
3. Install `gitlab runner operator`
4. Wait for the GitLab operator to create services and other resources.
5. Login to any node and try to access GitLab service using the service endpoint. See if the request is sent to GitLab operator pod or argocd-operator pod, repeat this step multiple times.

**Expected behavior**
Every operator resources should have unique labels and selectors.
