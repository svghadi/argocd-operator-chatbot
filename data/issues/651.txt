Add service annotations
We need to add ability to set annotations to the server object.
I'm trying to use external-dns to point it to internal ip address.
Hi @adubkov, can you elaborate on this?
Argocd operator creates `kind: Service` object in response of `kind: Argocd` resource.
It would be great to be able set custom annotations for that service in configuration of `kind:Argocd` resource.
We are using Datadog to collect ArgoCD metrics. For this we need to configure annotations on the service, which is not currently possible.

Another usecase is configuring Prometheus with annotations instead of ServiceMonitor.

Configuring service annotations for services created by operator should be IMHO basic functionality same way as it is done for Ingress/Route.
Does this functionality really not exist?
