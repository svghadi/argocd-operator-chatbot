Add resource compare option to CRD
Hello,

ArgoCD supports capability to ignore aggregated `ClusterRoles` by adding following to Argo's ConfigMap:
```
  resource.compareoptions: |
    # if ignoreAggregatedRoles set to true then differences caused by aggregated roles in RBAC resources are ignored.
    ignoreAggregatedRoles: true
```

It would be great if this could be configured using ArgoCD CRD.

Best regards,
Bostjan
Was this ever implemented?
I played around with it and saw that this can be sorted with `spec.extraConfig.resources.compareoptions.ignoreAggregatedRoles: true`
