Argo CD Server fails to connect to Dex
**Describe the bug**
One of the ways to enable OIDC/OAuth with Argo CD is to use Dex. Argo CD Server connects with Dex to verify the authentication of a user. 

However, this seems to be broken on the master.

This can also be reproduced by logging into the Argo CD Server Pod

If we look at the above screenshot and the error message, it is evident that HTTPS connection is accepted. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Login into the Argo CD Server Pod.
2. Try to connect to the Dex Service using HTTP.
`curl <dex-service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:5556`

**Expected behavior**
The above should not throw 400 (`client sent a HTTP request to an HTTPS server`)

**Screenshots**
Provided above.

**Additional context**
NA
