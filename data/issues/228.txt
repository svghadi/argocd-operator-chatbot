Unable to change admin password
Hi,

I used the ArgoCD 0.0.14 OpenShift operator to deploy an ArgoCD cluster, however we seem to be unable to change the admin password using the instructions documented here: https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/faq/#i-forgot-the-admin-password-how-do-i-reset-it

Our cluster looks like this:
```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: tim-argocd-test
spec:
  usersAnonymousEnabled: false
  controller:
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 1000m
        memory: 1024Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 512Mi
  server:
    host: <snip>
    insecure: true
    route:
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/tls-acme: 'true'
      enabled: true
      tls:
        insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
        termination: edge
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 1000m
        memory: 1024Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 512Mi
  dex:
    openShiftOAuth: false
```

The logs are showing these errors:
```
time="2021-01-20T11:41:35Z" level=warning msg="User admin failed login 1 time(s)"
time="2021-01-20T11:41:36Z" level=info msg="finished unary call with code Unauthenticated" error="rpc error: code = Unauthenticated desc = Invalid username or password" grpc.code=Unauthenticated grpc.method=Create grpc.service=session.SessionService grpc.start_time="2021-01-20T11:41:35Z" grpc.time_ms=944.012 span.kind=server system=grpc
```

We would like to use the OpenShift OAuth, however we also want to specify who can login and, especially, who cannot.
The operator sets up the password using a different mechanism.

You'll want to modify the secret https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/basics/#secrets which is based on your argocd resource name, for example "example-argocd-cluster"  in the "argocd" namespace..

This needs to be a bcrypt hashed string and can be generated in the same way as the argocd documentation recommends.
Ok, I feel like an idiot now. Thanks for your help. Case closed.
@tsterk I think we can maybe improve the documentation around this, I'd definitely say it's non-trivial to find (I only knew because I have read the code).
I'm reopening this, because I think we can do a better job of documenting this problem.
