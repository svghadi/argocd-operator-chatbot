Support `kustomize.version` in ArgoCD config-map
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Using the ArgoCD Operator, it is not possible to set `kustomize.version` in the ArgoCD config-map. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Update the `ArgoCD` CRD to support setting `kustomize.verion` as per https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.8/user-guide/kustomize/#custom-kustomize-versions.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Manually edit the ArgoCD config-map post creation of the operator. This is brittle and leads to issues should owned config-map get recreated.
