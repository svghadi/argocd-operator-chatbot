RFE: Add support to configure --app-resync for application controller
We use ArgoCD in a medium sized environment (currently four clusters with in total 96 application) which already induces a high load on the central git repo server, due to ArgoCD polling the repo server every 3 minutes. The number of applications and clusters will increase significantly in the near future, which will eventually lead to problems.
Since it's possible to increase that inverall by modifying the --app-resync parameter, it would be beneficial to be able to configure this via the ArgoCD.controller parameter.

For example like:
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
  labels:
    example: controller
spec:
  controller:
    processors:
      operation: 10
      status: 20
    app-resync: 360
    resources: {}
```

@ccdgrundhoefer Thanks for trying out the operator and for the suggestion.
