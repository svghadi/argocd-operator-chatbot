Please let me know if any additional info is needed,
I will have a look at this shortly @JTG2020, I think just have some old file names in there with the recent refactoring that I did. Thanks for the feedback!

@JTG2020 I believe that I fixed the issue with the document that you referenced. I still had the old CRD filename in the documentation. I ran through that install doc and it worked for me after I made the change. The update should be available in master.

The error that you were getting was due to the CRDs needed by the operator not being installed due to the filename not being correct in the documentation.
@JTG2020, Can you confirm that this is fixed for you in the latest documentation?

Thanks!
@jmckind Thank you. I'll test this out and provide you the feedback.
