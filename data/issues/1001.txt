Missing syntax-highlighting, toggle button for screen mode in argocd-operator docs
**Describe the bug**
I noticed that the argocd-operator documentation is missing the toggle change button at the top and syntax highlighting for the code blocks, which are present in the argocd-docs. These features provide better ease of use and enhance the overall appearance of the documentation website.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Check current argocd-operator docs and argocd-docs to see the difference


**Current behavior**

**Expected behavior**

**Additional context**
the above expected behavior screenshots are from my local mkdocs server by adding few changes int the mkdocs.yaml and requirements file
Add any other context about the problem here.

Implemented with #1002
