Bundle Installation fails due to the etcd limit of 1 MB.
**Describe the bug**
With the recent upgradation of ApplicationSets CRD to `v0.3.0` the operator bundle size has grown over 1 MB(~ 1.3 MB). This is a blocker for installing the operator using OLM.

OLM relies on etcd to store the bundle content. OLM copies the bundle files into a configmap and stores them in etcd which has a max object size restriction set to 1 MB. Unfortunately, the size of the bundle goes to 1.3 MB due to the increase in the size of applicationsets CRD from 400 KB to ~ 830 KB. This results in the installation failure.

Note:
OpenShift 4.9 and above, solved this problem by compressing the bundle data before it is stored into etcd. So, the issue is only with the < 4.9 versions of OpenShift and all versions of Kubernetes.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create the operator bundle(Please refer to the Makefile).
2. Install the operator using OLM. Installation results in a failure on < 4.9 versions of OpenShift and all versions of kubernetes.

**Expected behavior**
No error during the installation.
