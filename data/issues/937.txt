Failed to load initial state of resource
**Describe the bug**
After install ArgoCD using Operator on Openshift, Application and Cluster show errors for many such resources and the namespace added in the cluster
failed to sync cluster [https://172.21.0.1:443](https://172.21.0.1/): failed to load initial state of resource Service: services is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:gm4c-devops-factory:argocd-gm4c-argocd-application-controller" cannot list resource "services" in API group "" in the namespace "dev"

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Install the latest version of ArgoCD Operator in a single Namespace on OpenShift
2. Creat an instance of ArgoCD using the steps given here-
3. https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/basics/
4. Once the instance is Available, set the spec:server: route: enabled: true
5. Access ArgoCD on the Route created.
6. Login to the ArgoCD using admin
7. Add namespace dev to the in-cluster
8. Add Git repository
9. Create an application, choose namespace dev
10. Application shows multiple error messages as in the screenshot
11. Cluster shows error as in the screenshot

**Expected behavior**
The application should not show errors.
The Cluster should show a connected status

**Additional context**
the below log is for many such resources  and namespaces 
failed to sync cluster https://172.21.0.1:443: failed to load initial state of resource DaemonSet.apps: daemonsets.apps is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:gm4c-devops-factory:argocd-gm4c-argocd-application-controller" cannot list resource "daemonsets" in API group "apps" in the namespace "dev"

**We want to use ArgoCD for deploying only on a few Namespaces of OpenShift**
