Will be adding support for OAuth as the next feature, thanks for sharing this!
Currently working on this in the [oauth_support](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/tree/oauth_support) branch.
This has been [merged](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/pull/17) into master. Any further enhancements or bugs should use a new issue.
