Unable to setup ArgoCDExport for Azure
I'm trying to setup ArgoCDExport to make an export to Azure.
I followed your docs to setup ArgoCDExport for Azure.

I created a self-signed certificate and added it to the Azure SPN.

The azure.service.cert is in the following format.
```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```


The export container shows the following logs. Do you have any idea what could cause this issue?
``` bash
exporting argo-cd
creating argo-cd backup
encrypting argo-cd backup
pushing argo-cd backup to azure
The command failed with an unexpected error. Here is the traceback:

Hi @wouter2397 thank you for the report. I will have a look at this.
Hello @jmckind,

We found the issue regarding this problem.
Within the azure.service.cert you need to specify both the private key and the certificate.
After you do this the export works as expected.

I would suggest to add this to the documentation so its clear for others
