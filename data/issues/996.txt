breaking change when upgrading to argocd-operator:v0.7.0 ("managed-by" not working anymore in newly created namespaces - openshift/okd)
**Describe the bug**
We upgraded our ArgoCD-operator from v0.5.0 to v0.7.0 and noticed that new namespaces are not able to be managed by the correct ArgoCD-instance anymore when adding 
```bash
oc label namespace <namespace> \
argocd.argoproj.io/managed-by=<namespace>
```
ref. [this upstream argocd operator documentation](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/master/docs/usage/deploy-to-different-namespaces.md) and [this upstream openshift/okd documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/cicd/gitops/setting-up-argocd-instance.html#gitops-deploy-resources-different-namespaces_setting-up-argocd-instance)

**example of error message:**

>Namespace "renovate-bot" for ConfigMap "renovate-config" is not managed

**expected behavior:**

the following rolebindings should get created automatically when adding the above mentioned label:(this does not happen in `0.7.0`)

```yaml
Role/argocd-application-controller   
Role/argocd-grafana                  
Role/argocd-redis                    
Role/argocd-server 
```

**Screenshots**
New namespaces don't show up automatically under "NAMESPACES" when adding the above mentioned label in different namespaces.

**Additional info**
OKD-version: `4.13.0-0.okd-2023-08-04-164726`
k8s-version: `v1.26.6+73ac561`

When rolling back to v0.5.0, it immediately works again.

Sorry, small typo, I fixed the description now. :)

Additional info: 

We are running the default "namespace scoped instance" of ArgoCD, we are **not** running a [Cluster Scoped Instance](https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/basics/#cluster-scoped-instance). 
Hi @jaideepr97 

After some digging we found out the following permission issue in `v0.7.0`(`oc logs -f -c manager <argocd operator pod> -n openshift-operators`):

```
cannot list resource "prometheusrules" in API group "monitoring.coreos.com" at the cluster scope
```

When we add a custom Clusterrole that remediates the permission issue, it immediately starts working again! :)
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: argocd-operator-promrules-fix
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - monitoring.coreos.com
    resources:
      - prometheusrules
    verbs:
      - list
      - watch
```

Shall I or someone else create a PR on this?

Suggested fix is to add 
```yaml
  - apiGroups:
      - monitoring.coreos.com
    resources:
      - prometheusrules
    verbs:
      - list
      - watch
```
under `argocd-operator/config/rbac/role.yaml`
