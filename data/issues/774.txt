Argo CD Export not working for AWS S3 [aws: command not found]
**Describe the bug**
I started exploring Argo CD Export and realized that it is completely broken for AWS. 
```
pushing argo-cd backup to aws
/usr/local/bin/argocd-operator-util: line 64: aws: command not found
```

**Prerequisites**
1. AWS account
2. AWS credentials which needs to be stored in a Argo CD Export Secret later.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run the operator locally using `make install run`
3. Create an Argo CD Instance using
```
kubectl apply -f examples/<choose-from-multiple-examples>
```
4. Create AWS secret and Argo CD Export using
```
kubectl apply -f examples/argocdexport-aws.yaml
```
5. Wait for the operator to reconcile the Argo CD Export CR and create the export pod.
6. You can notice that the pod would never come up and goes into the `crashLoopBackOff` state.
```
pushing argo-cd backup to aws
/usr/local/bin/argocd-operator-util: line 64: aws: command not found
```

**Expected behavior**
A clean Export to AWS S3.

**Screenshots**
NA

**Additional context**
This looks like a simple fix. The AWS CLI installation is missing in the Argo CD Export Dockerfile.
