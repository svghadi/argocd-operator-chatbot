upon applying manifests, k8s suggest some security context to be set
run make deploy
gives below error 

W0527 14:34:01.484120   73360 warnings.go:67] would violate PodSecurity "restricted:latest": allowPrivilegeEscalation != false (container "kube-rbac-proxy" must set securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation=false), unrestricted capabilities (containers "kube-rbac-proxy", "manager" must set securityContext.capabilities.drop=["ALL"]), seccompProfile (pod or containers "kube-rbac-proxy", "manager" must set securityContext.seccompProfile.type to "RuntimeDefault" or "Localhost")

proposal:
add security context to manifest

@rishabh625 can you explain a bit about your proposal?
