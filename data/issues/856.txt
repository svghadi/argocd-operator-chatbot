Missing `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` that ArgoCD can fetch data about cluster resources
**Describe the bug**

ArgoCD deployed by the operator misses permission to show cluster resources, as there is not `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` for the `argocd-application-controller`.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Set `clusterResources=true` in `default-cluster-config`
2. Applications will fail as the controller tries to fetch the cluster resources, but fails as there is no permission set for that.

**Expected behavior**
The `argocd-application-controller` should have permission to fetch those resources as in the installation stack of ArgoCD.
See: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/tree/master/manifests/cluster-rbac/application-controller

**Additional context**
Applying the `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` from the link above resolves the problem.
