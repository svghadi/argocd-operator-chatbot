Applicationset Controller does not deploy service or enable port to reach new webhook feature
**Describe the bug**
As per [v0.3.0 of the Applicationset controller](https://blog.argoproj.io/applicationset-controller-v0-3-0-for-argo-cd-now-available-3f56bd643312), it has support for wehbook notifications, the current installation of the Applicationset controller being reconciled only installs a `Deployment`, `RoleBinding`s, `ServiceAccount` and `Role`, but no `Service`. The deployment is also missing the new port `7000` exposed for webhook events.

**To Reproduce**
1. Install the latest ArgoCD operator release
2. Enable the applicationSet controller option in your CRD installation
3. The installation only creates the above mentioned resources without exposing a port
4. The webhook is unreachable, since the deployment doesn't expose the port and a manual Service creation is needed.

**Expected behavior**
A similar service to the one created by the ApplicationSet controller project yamls should be created to allow the webhook to be reachable.
The deployment should also expose the port 7000 to allow for communication to the webhook.
