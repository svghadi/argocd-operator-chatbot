keycloak sso does nothing 
**Describe the bug**
```
  sso:
    provider: keycloak
    verifyTLS: false
```
Triggers nothing. There is no verbosity within the operator logs to see why. The entirety of the Argo ended side of deployment with operator does deploy successfully

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
```
  sso:
    provider: keycloak
    verifyTLS: false
```
Add to CRD 
**Expected behavior**
Keycloak to build, or error to occur within operator container manager logs 

argocd configmap to reflect the new keycloak integration - nothing happens
**Additional context**
The only differences between my deployment and the default, im using image 
2.3.0-rc5 and this relelease application crds for skipCRD capability. i rebuilt the operator to omit all repo server reconciles because my repo server has ksops integration. 

From what i can see, none of this would impact the sso.go code 

Any suggestions for how i can better get a look at why nothing is happening?? Thanks ! 
Hi @EHSchmitt4395 are you on openshift or kubernetes ?
Hey thanks for the speedy reply. I’m on kubernetes. Also tested without my custom operator and it still didn’t work despite other Argo resources kicking off.

Thanks !

let me try this real quick
can you share the `.status` of you argocd resource using kubectl `edit` or `get -oyaml` ? I want to see the value of ssoConfig field.
@EHSchmitt4395 
@iam-veeramalla  hey sorry just got home! 

```

status:
  applicationController: Running
  dex: Running
  phase: Available
  redis: Running
  repo: Running
  server: Running
  ssoConfig: Success
  ```

ok looks good. I will give it a try and get back to you. 

Do you want to tell me any specific steps that you followed at your end that I should know ?

my operator is built from 
    commit: b5c30f9f17c53e158623fb94ee3d87957ff5f2ae
    repo: https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator.git
    directory: /
    ref: v0.1.0
    
    as a base. But even when trying this version without changes just sso on, i get no response. 
   
my CRD 
```
spec:
  kustomizeBuildOptions: --enable-alpha-plugins
  image: mycustomimageurl
  version: 2.3.0-rc5
 ```
 wondering if sso may rely on this version key value? 
 
   Really appreciate you testing this, thankyou.  Outside of this, the operator by default does not support adding local users correct? 
   
 like 
 ```
 data:
  accounts.test-user: apiKey, login
 ```
 in cm ? 
Hi @EHSchmitt4395 , Sorry for getting back late on this one.

I looked into the reported issue on my kubernetes cluster today and in my case the integration is working like a charm.

1. keycloak deployment created.
2. operator updated the argocd-cm for the required OIDC changes.
3. operator created realm, client and scopes required in the keycloak.
4. I was able to create a user in keycloak and login to argo cd.


Can you upgrade/re-build you custom operator from latest version/release of argocd-operator ? Currently we are v0.2.1  and I see you are using v0.1.0. 
Closing this due to lack of response. Please feel free to re-open the issue if you would like to.
