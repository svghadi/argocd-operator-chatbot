route creation in Openshift
Hello,
I'm trying to create ArgoCD with Routes in my OCP 4.4 following this page: https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/routes/
ArgoCD operator `0.0.9 provided by Argo CD Community `


```bash
$ echo "
> apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
> kind: ArgoCD
> metadata:
>   name: main-argocd
>   namespace: argocd
> spec:
>   server:
>     route:
>       enabled: true
> " | oc apply -f -
The ArgoCD "main-argocd" is invalid: spec.server.route: Invalid value: "object": spec.server.route in body must be of type boolean: "object"
```
I was using example from 0.0.10 operator version while running 0.0.9, my bad :)
