Add ability to customize Host of Route in ArgoCD CRD ( argocd.spec.server.route.host )
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
ArgoCD CRD generates dynamically the Host of the Route which is very long host  : `openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.apps.company.lan`
and not easy to memorize in a team environment.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to be able to customize that host: 

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  finalizers:
  - argoproj.io/finalizer
  name: openshift-gitops
  namespace: openshift-gitops
spec:
  # .....
  server:
     # ...
    route:
      enabled: true
      host: gitops.apps.company.lan
# ....
```

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
For now, I considered to create a job , changing directly the resource of type `Route` , and package that job in our corporate helm chart.

**Additional context**
k8s 1.24 , openshift 4.11

Any update Ya Guys ?
Hi @abdennour , You can achieve this using the below example.
```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
  labels:
    example: route
spec:
  # ......
  server:
    host: argoroute.example.com
    route:
      enabled: true
```

Yeah, I agree that the position of `host` in the `.spec` looks out of place. One reason I can think off is that the `host` field is common for ingress and routes , so thats the reason why it is under `.spec` and not `.spec.route`. However, I feel it should have been under `.spec.route` and `.spec.ingress` both.
Awesome! Thanks for the info.
Tested & confirmed
