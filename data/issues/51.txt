Add Support for Backups to an Azure Storage Container 
The operator should support storing exports/backups in an Azure storage container.
Working on this in the [azure_export](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/tree/azure_export) branch.
Merged into master and will go out in the v0.0.9 release.
