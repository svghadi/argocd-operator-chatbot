Use Host Field for TLS Certificate
The certificate that is generated for Argo server uses the ArgoCD metadata.name in the SAN. Since the operator supports providing a host field, it might make sense to use that if provided, and fallback to the CRD name if absent, for the SAN hosts.
I think this was fixed by the v0.0.14 release?
