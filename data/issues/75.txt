ArgoCD CR Should List Status for All Argo CD Components 
Currently, the operator only populates a Status value for the Argo CD server component. In addition, the value for the Status `Phase` is only computed currently based on the value of the server component Status currently.

The operator should list the status for each of the following Argo CD components and use each of these status values in the final determination for the Status `Phase` value.

- Application Controller
- Dex
- Redis
- Repo Server
- Server
This has been merged into master as part of #104 and will go out in the next release.
