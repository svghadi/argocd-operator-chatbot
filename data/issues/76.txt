ArgoCD doesn't work in a disconnected environment
Hi,

I've been testing ArgoCD operator version 0.0.8 and it seems the ArgoCD controller and server are deployed fine in a disconnected environment in OpenShift (using cluster-wide proxy). But when I tried to deploy an Application, the server cannot reach an external repository like Github.

Would be possible to add the cluster-wide proxy env vars to server ? Or any method so we can add custom environment variables ?

Environment:
- Openshift 4.3
- ArgoCD operator 0.08
- ArgoCD 1.5.2

Hey @aelbarkani , thanks for trying out the operator!

I think the operator should be able to support this use-case with minor changes hopefully. :)

Have you been able to make this work using the standard upstream Argo CD install manifests? If so, would you mind sharing the ENV VARs that you added?

@aelbarkani I just wanted to check in and let you know that I have not forgotten about this issue. Did you have a chance to see my question above?
+1.  We need a way to tell the operator to set proxy server params in each relevant pod.  In the meantime, do this....

```
BASE_DOMAIN=your.domain.com
WILDCARD=apps.$BASE_DOMAIN
HTTPS_PROXY=http://1.2.3.4:3128
HTTP_PROXY=http://1.2.3.4:3128
NO_PROXY=argocd-server-argocd,argocd-dex-server,.$WILDCARD,.$BASE_DOMAIN,127.0.0.1,localhost,.local,.internal,172.30.0.0/16

PATCHLINE="{\"spec\":{\"template\":{\"spec\":{\"containers\":[{\"name\":\"argocd-server\",\"env\":[{\"name\":\"HTTPS_PROXY\",\"value\":\"$HTTPS_PROXY\"},{\"name\":\"HTTP_PROXY\",\"value\":\"$HTTP_PROXY\"},{\"name\":\"NO_PROXY\",\"value\":\"$NO_PROXY\"}]}]}}}}"
oc patch deploy argocd-server --patch "$PATCHLINE"

PATCHLINE="{\"spec\":{\"template\":{\"spec\":{\"containers\":[{\"name\":\"argocd-repo-server\",\"env\":[{\"name\":\"HTTPS_PROXY\",\"value\":\"$HTTPS_PROXY\"},{\"name\":\"HTTP_PROXY\",\"value\":\"$HTTP_PROXY\"},{\"name\":\"NO_PROXY\",\"value\":\"$NO_PROXY\"}]}]}}}}"
oc patch deploy argocd-repo-server --patch "$PATCHLINE"

```
I will take on this.
Proxy env vars are propagated to argocd workloads.
