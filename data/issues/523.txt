Namespace Isolation Forced? 
**Describe the bug**
Namespace isolation mode is forced with operator install
**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install the operator described via docs

**Expected behavior**
Docs describe no method to install argocd via operator with namespace isolation mode off.  A

**Additional context**
I'd prefer to continue using argocd operator to install argocd. Otherwise i have to use generic install.yaml from argocd repo without understanding why i cant just turn it off with the operator

Hi @EHSchmitt4395 , are you using Argo CD Operator version 0.1.0 ?

Do you want to use a single Argo CD instance for the whole cluster ?
Hey ! yeah using  0.1.0  - i do ! Would prefer to either be able to allow all namespaces as managed or just turn off namespace isolation all together. Thanks for the reply! 
@iam-veeramalla is there another way thats not obviously stated that enables such functionality :o ? (to disable namespace isolation and enable all namespaces to be managed?)
also setting 
```

All Namespaces
```
in cluster settings does not work as expected

solved with subscription setting 
```
    env:
      - name: ARGOCD_CLUSTER_CONFIG_NAMESPACES
        value: '*'
      - name: DISABLE_DEFAULT_ARGOCD_INSTANCE
        value: 'true'
```
Hey a question, where do I need to add those settings? Is it the deploy/subscription.yaml like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: argocd-operator
spec:
  channel: alpha
  name: argocd-operator
  source: argocd-catalog
  sourceNamespace: olm
  config:
    env:
      - name: ARGOCD_CLUSTER_CONFIG_NAMESPACES
        value: '*'
      - name: DISABLE_DEFAULT_ARGOCD_INSTANCE
        value: 'true'
```
