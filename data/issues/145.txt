Changing the properties of the ArgoCD resource has no effect
Our stand is:

- OpenShift 4.5.2
- ArgoCD Operator v0.0.12 (is installed from UI)
- ArgoCD Resource:

```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  server:
    route:
      enabled: true
```

If we add or modify some specifications on ArgoCD resource - should the ArgoCD operator detect these changes and make changes to the required resources (argocd itself, route, ingress etc.)?

For ex.: I want to add insecure/TLS options:

```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  server:
    insecure: true
    route:
      enabled: true
      TLS:
        termination: edge
```

But after applying these changes, nothing happens. (oc apply -f ...)

When playing with ingress, I found I had to change `enabled` to `false` and then back to `true`. So you probably need to do the same thing for `route`.
