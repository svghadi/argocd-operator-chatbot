HelpChat cannot be disabled via Operator-Property
**Describe the bug**
When setting `helpChatURL: ''` within ArgoCD custom resource, the value is not propagated to the argocd-cm ConfigMap

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Configure ArgoCD custom resource with
```
spec:
  helpChatURL: ''
```
2. Look at ConfigMap argocd-cm. There it says:
```
  help.chatUrl: 'https://mycorp.slack.com/argo-cd'
```

An empty string would hide the "Chat" button within ArgoCD. With the URL set, the button is always shown.

**Workaround**
It is possible to configure the ArgoCD custom resource as follows to get the `''` in argocd-cm

```
spec:
  extraConfig:
    help.chatUrl: ''
```

**Expected behavior**
The empty string should appear in argocd-cm.

**Additional context**

The root cause seems to be the `len(...) > 0` here:

What would the requirement of an empty url string be?
An empty URL string seems to be the only way to hide the chat button on the lower right side of ArgoCD UI. As we do not have a help chat, the button is rather pointless, so I tried to remove it from the UI.

Makes sense @MichaelWarnecke, I will fix this behaviour.
