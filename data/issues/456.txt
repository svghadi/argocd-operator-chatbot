Additional ENVs are not getting configured (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, no_proxy)
**Describe the bug**
Adding proxy ENVs while deploying basic argocd (after deploying argocd-operator), the ENVs are not reflected. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Deploy ArgoCD Operator (Latest version v0.0.15)
2. Deploy basic ArgoCD (YAML attached)
3. Check ArgoCD Repo Server has ENV set
[ArgoCD-Install.zip](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/files/7329635/ArgoCD-Install.zip)


**Expected behavior**
ENV should reflect the proxy values.

Thanks for confirming @iam-veeramalla. One quick detail - Will this support only proxy related ENVs or any other ENVs also ? 
> lated ENVs or any other ENV

Other ENVs also :)
we have released operator v0.2.0. Please feel free to re-open the issue if you still see this after upgrading.
