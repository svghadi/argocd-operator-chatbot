Transition to New Operator Bundle Format
The format for operator bundles is changing and the operator should support this new format.

See

https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/issues/1680

and 

https://github.com/operator-framework/bundle-example
This has been added along with #91.
Merged as part of #99 and will go out in the v0.1.0 release.
