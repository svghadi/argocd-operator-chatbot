Keeps rewriting argocd-ssh-known-hosts-cm
When I apply my own configmap with SSH known hosts it stays for several minutes and then gets re-written wit the default one. Is there any way to stop this? According to docs, I'm trying to do it the way it was supposed to...
The operator now manages the `argocd-ssh-known-hosts-cm` ConfigMap. The `SSHKnownHosts` property on the ArgoCD CRD was made available in v0.0.5 to pass in custom hosts. See the latest docs for this, as they were updated recently.

https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/argocd/#ssh-known-hosts 

Here is an example of setting the SSH known hosts.

```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
  labels:
    example: ssh-known-hosts
spec:
  sshKnownHosts: |
    bitbucket.org ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC...
    github.com ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC...

```

Does this fix the issue that you are seeing? More importantly, with this work for your use-case?
Oh, sorry! I was using old docs. Now everything is great! Thanks!
