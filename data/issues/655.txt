Create/delete notifications config/resources in operator
The argocd-notifications controller uses the argocd-notifications-cm configmap to manage notifications. The configmap contains the notification triggers configurations as well as the available notification templates. We will have some triggers/templates configured in the cm out of the box.

We agreed not to override cm.  During this phase, we are not managing the content in the cm. We only perform creation and deletion.

**Acceptance criteria:**

unit tests
 these resources are created when notifications is enabled and deleted when notifications is disabled.
argocd-notifications-cm
argocd-notifications-secret
can be closed?
