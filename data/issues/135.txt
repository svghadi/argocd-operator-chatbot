ArgoCD Operator doesn't have enough authority to deploy Azure Files PVC on OpenShift on Azure
**Checklist:

* [x] I've searched in the docs and FAQ for my answer: http://bit.ly/argocd-faq.
* [x] I've included steps to reproduce the bug.
* [x] I've pasted the output of `argocd version`.

**Describe the bug**

ArgoCD Operator doesn't have enough authority to deploy PVC on OpenShift on Azure.
Failed to sync the repository which has the Azure Files PVC resources.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: foo-demo
spec:
  storageClassName: azurefiles # which mounts Azure Files
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
status: {}
```

**To Reproduce**

1. Prepare OpenShift on Azure.
2. Install ArgoCD Operator via OperatorHub.
3. Sync the repository.

**Expected behavior**

Sync the repository which has the PVC resources if no more authorities for ArgoCD Operator or add the explanation about the RBAC.

**How did you get around the issue?**

Add the cluster-admin-role to ArgoCD Operator and ReSync.
(I supposed it's too much authority.)

```shell
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:foo-demo:argocd-application-controller
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cluster-admin added: "system:serviceaccount:foo-demo:argocd-application-controller"
```

**Version**

* ArgoCD Operator
`0.0.12 provided by Argo CD Community`

* OpenShift

  ```shell
  Client Version: 4.4.6
  Server Version: 4.4.6
  Kubernetes Version: v1.17.1+f63db30
  ```
@soharaki Do you happen to have the error message that you received when you tried to create this PVC?

This is an error message for "delete" from the ArgoCD web console, but the same error happens with "patch".
The ArgoCD-controller is deployed on the same ns as PVC.

```shell
Unable to delete resource: persistentvolumeclaims "example" is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:foo-demo:argocd-server" cannot delete resource "persistentvolumeclaims" in API group "" in the namespace "foo-demo"
```
@soharaki So the PVC gets created fine but cannot be deleted?
I believe that this is an issue with the roles for the argocd application-controller/server and not the operator itself based on that error and your workaround.

Just for some background with regard to the roles, I mirrored those defined [upstream](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/v1.6.1/manifests/install.yaml#L2028-L2069) but notice that the non cluster roles do not allow for managing PVCs. I also reduced the cluster roles to read-only based on the [docs](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/security/#cluster-rbac). The main reason for doing that was to get the operator into the OpenShift Operator Hub where cluster-admin as the default is a blocker.

the PVC cannnot get created, patched and deleted.

@jmckind 

Thanks for the answer.
I understand the background of different Role given to ArgoCD's argocd-application-controller and ArgoCD operator's.

`https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/e540fb87289969e76c95dbba2927d71161778f02/deploy/role.yaml#L89`

`https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/v1.6.1/manifests/install.yaml#L2078`

And the azure-files provider need read/write  ClusterRole permission to read and write the secrets, as shown in the following URL.

https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/525#issuecomment-458983313

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: system:azure-cloud-provider
rules:
- apiGroups: ['']
  resources: ['secrets']
  verbs:     ['get','create']
```

It will always fail to synchronize the PVC since the operator does not have the ClusterRole.
This is unavoidable as long as we distribute operators in the OpenShift Operator Hub where cluster-admin as the default is a blocker.

If you can, please make these explanations clear somewhere.
Thank you very much.
