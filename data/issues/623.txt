Repo Server Image should use spec.version if spec.repo.version is not set
**Describe the bug**
When using a different ArgoCD version than the default version set by the operator, we set spec.version in the CR.
Documentation states for spec.version: "**The tag to use with the container image for all Argo CD components**." (https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/argocd/#version)

The repo server, however, does not respect this value but only looks at spec.repo.version or falls back to defaults

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install ArgoCD with operator version 0.3.0 
2. Create an ArgoCD instance and set spec.version to 2.2.5
3. Observe repo server deployment - it has the image SHA digest of ArgoCD image 2.3.3

**Expected behavior**
Repo Server falls back to spec.version if spec.repo.version ist not set
