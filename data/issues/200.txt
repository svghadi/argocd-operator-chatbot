openshift system:serviceaccount:argocd:argocd-application-controller create svc error
In openshift, system:serviceaccount:argocd:argocd-application-controller can't create svc or deployment because the serviceaccount doesn't have corresponding permissions.
So, I have to run this command "oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:argocd:argocd-application-controller" manually
