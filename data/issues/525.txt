Reconcile Pause For Custom Resource? 
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Hey guys is there any available featuresets that allow for reconciliation to pause? I have a custom repo-server deployment that relies on some env vars. Reconciling and making sure i have my correct custom deployment of repo-server is a constant battle..

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Ideally i could avoid the reconcile feature of the repo-server specifically. 
**Describe alternatives you've considered**
possibly a way to pause reconcile ? 

**Additional context**
Appreciate the wisdom ! Is there a possible work around to do this ? I deploy argo operator with kustomize and basically over write the deployment for repo-server. So the reconcile slaps back.
Hey @EHSchmitt4395 , Why dont you add those Env vars to the Argo CD CR ? 
hey @iam-veeramalla  ---- its more than env vars -- its basically the viaduct sops setup for integrating mozilla sops and kustomize plugins to the repo server  :/

I think you have to use a custom build of ArgoCD operator and move repo-server out of reconciliation loop.
@iam-veeramalla   that sounds like allllooot more work than just stopping the operator from reconcile -- anything else i can do ? Shorter time frame?  -- something in the operator code? Or ? Thanks for the hasty replys !!
where is reconcile loop for repo server -- maybe i can just comment out and rebuild the dockerfile?

Here you go 
https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/2f43a08b7aa806a4468ba7e6c64404bdbb8fbacf/controllers/argocd/deployment.go#L333

@iam-veeramalla awesome many thanks!~ Ill give that a go !

Quick question -- Developer Docs demonstrate using 
```
ARGOCD_CLUSTER_CONFIG_NAMESPACES=argocd-e2e-cluster-config make install run
```
for modifying namespaces 
The make install comand is just doing 
```
	$(KUSTOMIZE) build config/crd | kubectl apply -f -
```
But there is no reference to this var anywhere in the kustomization in the config/crd directory?   How would i add this manually if i dont want to use go? I just want kustomize to do this for me ? 

in config/default kustomization there is a vars: section --- is this essentially what we are doing with the go command? 

What would that look like ?
```
vars: 
   
- name: ARGOCD_CLUSTER_CONFIG_NAMESPACES
  objref:
    kind: Namespace
    version: v1
    name: '*'
``` 

Thanks so much!! 


i want to run completely open --  before i would add to my subscription file 
```
  config:
    env:
      - name: ARGOCD_CLUSTER_CONFIG_NAMESPACES
        value: '*'
      - name: DISABLE_DEFAULT_ARGOCD_INSTANCE
        value: 'true'
```

This would allow me to deploy to any cluster.  Now through manual method of deploying CRDS and build - i get strict namespace scope to where argo was deployed + a 
  ```
  Cluster level CustomResourceDefinition "applications.argoproj.io" can not be managed when in namespaced mode
  ```
error :/
