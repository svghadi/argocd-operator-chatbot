Fix openshift documentation please
### Is your task related to a problem? Please describe.
The file paths listed in the openshift documentation do not exist in the repository. Leaving me confused as to exact install process.
https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/master/docs/install/openshift.md

oc create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
oc create -f deploy/role.yaml
oc create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml

oc create -f deploy/argo-cd

oc create -f deploy/crds

oc create -f deploy/operator.yaml


### Describe the solution you'd like
Someone please update the openshift install manual to the correct process.

### Describe alternatives you've considered
I might try guessing at the right way to do this.

### Additional context
I am not an experienced user. I am trying to learn OpenShift and ArgoCD. But the incorrect documentation makes me afraid at what else is missing or outdated.

Thanks for raising this @rcfja , we will take a look. Did you try the steps ? where did you get struck ? can you provide some more details ?
Even the very first command on the documentation fails ..

```
> git clone https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator.git

> cd argocd-operator

> oc create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
error: the path "deploy/service_account.yaml" does not exist
```

I can't find a file with the name service_account.yaml

Thanks for letting us know, we migrated to new version of operator-sdk. I thought we updated our documentation but seems like we need to do more work on this.
I am not sure if this is worthy of a new issue, but after installing argocd-operator using Operator Hub and configuring dex with openshift login as described here: https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/dex/#dex-openshift-oauth-connector . The authentication seems to fail with the following message:
`Failed to authenticate: openshift: user "<openshift_userid>" is not in any of the required groups.`

I did create the groups and added the openshift_userid into the group (on openshift) as described here: https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/dex/#role-mappings

Please let me know if this should be posted instead as a new issue?
@adarshaj Please open a new issue :)
