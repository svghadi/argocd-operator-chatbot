Handle the case when both Keycloak and Dex are configured in the CR.
**Describe the bug**
Argo CD Operator currently supports two SSO providers `Dex` and `Keycloak`. `Keycloak` can be configured using the `.sso.provider: keycloak` and Dex can be configured using `.spec.dex`. This leads to a great chance of misconfiguration, A user can unknowingly or intentionally add both `Keycloak` and `Dex` to the CR.

This scenario should be handled. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run the operator locally using `make install && make run`
2. Create an Argo CD CR with Keycloak as SSO provider
```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
  labels:
    example: route
spec:
  sso:
    provider: keycloak
    verifyTLS: false
  server:
    route:
     enabled: tru
```
3.  Now add Dex as another SSO provider
```
.......
dex:
  openShiftOAuth: true
```
**Expected behavior**
Only one SSO provider should be allowed.
