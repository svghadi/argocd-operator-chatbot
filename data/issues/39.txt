[Feature] Support ArgoCD 1.5 (Helm 3, much faster, ...)
Hi,

could you support ArgoCD v1.5 in the next release? It contains support for Helm 3 and is much (!) faster than ever.

Thanks a lot and greetings,

Josef
Now that 1.5 is released, will add support for it in the next release.
Working on this in the [argo_15](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/tree/argo_15) branch.
This has been merged to master and will go out in the v0.0.6 release.
Released as part of v0.0.6.
