Username of logged in user
Add user mapping of logging in user (via OAuth) to `USER INFO` section - it is currently blank. There is currently no way to see which user is logged in, just group memberships.

Not sure if this is possible considering the supported RBAC options, but would be helpful.

Hi @arctiqhart, thank you for the suggestion and trying out the operator. I will have a look to see if this is something that we can add from the operator side, but it may be that Argo CD itself would need a change for this.

@bigkevmcd Any ideas?
Hey @jmckind 
upstream argo-cd does display the user's name in user-info

I think there should be a way to fix this in the operator
I could try to look into it if that's alright
