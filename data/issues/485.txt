operator v0.1.0 ArgoCDExport Resource stuck in Pending phase
creating an ArgoCDExport resource (after the ArogCD cluster is up and running) using v0.1.0 doesn't start a kubernetes job, it's just stuck in **Pending** state. Local and AWS backends tested.

The problem seems to be that it's looking for the service account "argocd-application-controller" while the operator creates "argocd-argocd-application-controller"

I think the issue is caused by this line?
