I was trying with the same config and the have got the same error. 
Any chance of looking into this?

Thank you for raising this issue @u849296. I will look into this.
I can see why it doesn't work. In openshift the export-pod runs with uid 999, but the backup volume is owned by root with permission 770.  Running the pod as root is usually not an option for production clusters.
Hope this get fixed soon. Having to rely on manual scripts is just a workaround.
Its hightime we take this as priority. Having an export option and it not working its really not recommended.
