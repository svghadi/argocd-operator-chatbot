Add support for application namespaces
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
In https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/9755 Argo CD gained support for pulling in Application from outside of the namespace Argo CD is being deployed.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
As this feature will be added to Argo CD 2.5 I would be happy if argocd-operator would be able to support this parameter.
@ishitasequeira is already working on this one. Thanks for raising the enhancement @tongpu 

If there is `spec.controller.extraCommandArgs`, this config would work:
``` yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
  labels:
    example: server
spec:
  resourceTrackingMethod: annotation+label
  controller:
   # Does not exists 
    extraCommandArgs:
      - '--application-namespaces=*'
  server:
    extraCommandArgs:
      - '--application-namespaces=*'
```
This will allow the user to use new features before they are supported by the operator.

I also see `--application-namespaces` is generated from `spec.sourceNamespaces`, but setting it to `["*"]` will cause this error when reconciling Role(?):
```
1.6831749006287725e+09	ERROR	controller.argocd	Reconciler error	{"reconciler group": "argoproj.io", "reconciler kind": "ArgoCD", "name": "app", "namespace": "argocd", "error": "Namespace \"*\" not found"}
```

My current workaround is to disable the operator...
