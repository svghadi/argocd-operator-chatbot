Support H/A Deployments for Argo CD
The operator should support being run in H/A mode, outlined in the official documentation.

I have starting working on this in the [argo_ha](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/tree/argo_ha) branch.
This had been merged into master and will go out with the v0.0.5 release this week.
Released as part of v0.0.5.
