argocd-operator configured with Dex not working for openshift login
After installing argocd-operator using Operator Hub and configuring dex with openshift login as described here: https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/dex/#dex-openshift-oauth-connector . The authentication seems to fail with the following message:
`Failed to authenticate: openshift: user "<openshift_userid>" is not in any of the required groups.`

I did create the groups and added the openshift_userid into the group (on openshift) as described here: https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/dex/#role-mappings

@adarshaj Can you please provide your dex configuration ? I think you are using the `groups` property, Please remove that from your Argo CD CR or add the openshift user to the group that you mentioned under the `groups` property.

Your Argo CD CR should look something like below, if you dont need the default group features(only user part of this default groups can login).

```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
  labels:
    example: openshift-oauth
spec:
  dex:
    openShiftOAuth: true
  rbac:
    defaultPolicy: 'role:readonly'
    policy: |
      g, cluster-admins, role:admin
    scopes: '[groups]'
```

Here's my ArgoCD CR:
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: myapp-argocd
  namespace: argocd
  labels:
    myapp: openshift-oauth
spec:
  ha:
    enabled: true
    redisProxyImage: haproxy
    redisProxyVersion: "2.0.4"
  dex:
    openShiftOAuth: true
    groups:
     - default
  rbac:
    defaultPolicy: 'role:readonly'
    policy: |
      g, cluster-admins, role:admin
    scopes: '[groups]'
  grafana:
    enabled: true
    route:
      enabled: true
  prometheus:
    enabled: true
    route:
      enabled: true
  server:
    route:
      enabled: true
```

On Openshift, I've executed these commands:
```bash
oc adm groups new cluster-admins
oc adm groups add-users cluster-admins openshift_userid
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group cluster-admin cluster-admins
```
You were right! Removing the groups key of dex config worked! Shall I send PR to update the codeblock on https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/dex/#dex-openshift-oauth-connector page?
Sure, Please :)
I revisited the documentation and the usage of `groups` is clearly mentioned. @adarshaj If you still find issues with documentation. Please feel free to open a new issue or PR.
