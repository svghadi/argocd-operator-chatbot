Errors in ClusterServiceVersion 'argocd-operator.v0.8.0': OwnNamespace InstallModeType not supported, cannot configure to watch own namespace
**Describe the bug**
The installation of the argocd-operator fails in the last step, no argocd-operator pods are being started. The reason might be the error visible in the clusterServiceVersion argocd-operator.v0.8.0

```
Events:
  Type     Reason                    Age                    From                        Message
  ----     ------                    ----                   ----                        -------
  Warning  UnsupportedOperatorGroup  2m35s (x2 over 2m35s)  operator-lifecycle-manager  OwnNamespace InstallModeType not supported, cannot configure to watch own namespace
```

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Follow the [documentation](https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/olm/) and copy&paste snippets from the git repository at [./deploy/](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/tree/v0.8.0/deploy).

Be sure to patch the olm namespace to work around #945 

- `catalogsource` is created successfully
- catalog pod is started successfully
- `operatorgroup` is created successfully
- `subscription` is created successfully
- `installplan` is created successfully, but shows the error above
- NO argocd-operator pods are being started

**Expected behavior**
The `installplan` should not show errors and the argocd-operator pod show start.

**Additional context**
k3s singlenode cluster running on openSUSE Leap 15.5
olm installed via their latest instructions (v0.26.0)
Putting the operatorgroup and the subscription into a third namespace `argocd-operator` brings up this error in the csv:

```
Events:
  Type     Reason                    Age                From                        Message
  ----     ------                    ----               ----                        -------
  Warning  UnsupportedOperatorGroup  99s (x2 over 99s)  operator-lifecycle-manager  SingleNamespace InstallModeType not supported, cannot configure to watch one namespace
```

Putting the operatorgroup into `argocd-operator` and the subscription into `argocd` errors out, because `csv in namespace with no operatorgroups`
Removing the `targetNamespaces` from the `operatorgroup`, which makes this a "global" operatorgroup, leads to the installation of the ArgoCD Operator being successfully. And I can then successfully install a ArgoCD instance into the `argocd` namespace.
Hi @johanneskastl , argocd-operator no longer supports namespace install mode. We had to drop the namespace install mode inorder to support conversion webhook for api upgrades. 

There are few more breaking changes in 0.8.0 release. Please refer [release notes](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/releases/tag/v0.8.0) for more details.
@svghadi Thanks for the fast reply! Then I guess the example deployment files should be adapted?

https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/master/deploy/operator_group.yaml#L6

This still contains the `targetNamespaces`...
