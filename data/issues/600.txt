Disable creating initial secret for ArgoCD export
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Creating a default secret causes conflicts when the actual secret values are synchronized from an external store by some tool (eg. ExternalSecrets).

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Disable creating a default secret with a default backup key trusting that it will eventually be there.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I've opened an issue in ExternalSecrets to resolve the conflicts when a secret already exists, but I find that to be a more difficult solution compared to just not creating the secret in the first place.
