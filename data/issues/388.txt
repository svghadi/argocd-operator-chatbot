Operator errors on reconciling namespaces, Cannot list resource "namespace"
**Describe the bug**
Operator errors on reconciling namespaces, Cannot list resource "namespace"

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a new operator build using the below steps.
  - Replace env variables in env.sh
  - Run ./hack/build.sh
  - ./hack/push.sh
  - ./hack/bundle.sh
  - ./hack/registry.sh
  - Create catalog source with the image in the previous step
2. Install the operator in default namespace.
3. Create a basic Argo CD resource from installed operators -> ArgoCD -> YAML view -> Create
4. Log the operator pod to see the below error.
`E0802 08:01:24.138395       1 reflector.go:178] sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/cache/internal/informers_map.go:224: Failed to list *v1.Namespace: namespaces is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:default:argocd-operator" cannot list resource "namespaces" in API group "" at the cluster scope`

**Expected behavior**
No error
@shubhamagarwal19  Do you know what is going wrong here ?

Do we need something like this for the `argocd-operator` serviceaccount ?

From the error, it clearly says that the `serviceAccount` does not have enough permissions to list the `namespace resource`. Also, like you suggested the fix would be to add the namespace resource to the list of resources in the permissions defined in CSV. 
Thanks for reporting this @iam-veeramalla !! 
@iam-veeramalla is the issue reproduced in Openshift GitOps Operator 1.2?
@wtam2018  no ... It works on the GitOps-operator

@iam-veeramalla bundle.sh builds a bundle picking up matadata files from deploy/olm-catalog which have not been updated yet.   After operator-sdk upgrade, the tool scripts/bundle building will be changed.   We might want to wait until operator upgrade is done.
