Unable to pull from internal repo
Hello :)

at my work we have a gitserver which is only reachable internally thereby signed by our inhouse CA while im able to add the Server Cert under the Settings/Repositories im not able to create an application with this repo. 
I get the following error 

```Unable to create application: application spec is invalid: InvalidSpecError: Unable to get app details: rpc error: code = Internal desc = Failed to fetch git repo: `git fetch origin --tags --force` failed exit status 128: fatal: unable to access 'https://abc.defg.de/sandro/wordpress.git/': gnutls_handshake() failed: Key usage violation in certificate has been detected.```

Checking the [Repository](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd) i see a lot of similar issue but no solution :(
So i wonder if you might have a fix for this :)
