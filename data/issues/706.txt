Help Needed: How to set environment variables for pods managed by Operator in Openshift
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
We have installed argocd via operator in Openshift. But when I am trying to add a cluster I am getting forbidden error.

```
$ ./argocd cluster add gitops/console-openshift-console-apps-ocp6-sr1-ag1-sp-xxxx-local:6443/xxxx@xxxxx.com
WARNING: This will create a service account `argocd-manager` on the cluster referenced by context `gitops/console-openshift-console-apps-ocp6-sr1-ag1-sp-xxx-local:6443/xxxx@xxxxx.com` with full cluster level privileges. Do you want to continue [y/N]? y
INFO[0002] ServiceAccount "argocd-manager" already exists in namespace "kube-system"
INFO[0002] ClusterRole "argocd-manager-role" updated  
INFO[0002] ClusterRoleBinding "argocd-manager-role-binding" updated
FATA[0002] rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Get "[https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp6.sr1.ag1.sp.xxx.local:6443/version?timeout=32s":](https://console-openshift-console.apps.xxx.sr1.ag1.sp.ibm.local:6443/version?timeout=32s%22:) Forbidden
$
```
And I figured out that this is coming from our proxy server and need to add the cluster to no_proxy list.

But when I am editing the deployment openshift-gitops-server or openshift-gitops-dev-server, the operator is overriding the changes to the no_proxy variable.  

And current no_proxy variable is already populated with below data. 

```
 - name: NO_PROXY
          value: .cluster.local,.svc,10.128.0.0/16,100.71.244.32/27,127.0.0.1,158.87.48.0/24,172.30.0.0/16,ag1nsxt-vc.sp.xxx.local,api-int.ocp4.sr1.ag1.sp.xxxxx.local,apps.ocp4.sr1.ag1.sp.xxxx.local,cluster.ocp2.sr1.ag1.sp.xxx.local,localhost,oauth-openshift.apps.ocp4.sr1.ag1.sp.xxx.local,ocp4.sr1.ag1.spxxx.local
```

When I try to set it in Argocd object I get the below message.

When I go the GitOpsService object cluster referenced above, I dont see anything under spec.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
So need your help or inputs on how to update the no_proxy variable and also to understand from where this variable already got the above information from.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

I figured it out myself. We need to add it in cluster wide proxy. Hence closing it.
