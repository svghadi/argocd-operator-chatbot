RFE: Add the ability to define clusters at deployment
It would be cool to be able to define clusters you want your ArgoCD installation to manage when you deploy an instance with the operator.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  managedClusters:
  - name: cluster1
    api: api.cluster1.example.com:6443
    sslVerify: false
    token: <long token string>
  - name: cluster2
    api: api.cluster2.example.com:6443
    token: <long token string>
    sslVerify: true
    caCert: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

The token should come from a user (or serviceaccount) with the proper privileges (for example, the `kubeadmin` user token). 
Would it make sense to have those tokens stored in a secret that can be referenced in the CR, rather than have the actual token in there? Same thing for the cert data? That makes the logic in the operator more involved but I think would clean up the CR a bit.

+1 I think that would be a better approach.
+1 I like this idea.
