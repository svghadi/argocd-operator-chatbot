Argo CD .status.host field is not updated when using Ingress on OpenShift clusters. 
**Describe the bug**
PR #514 adds a new field(host) to the Argo CD CR `.status`. This is useful to retrieve the Argo CD server host name. 

While this feature works as expected when customers use `Ingress on Kubernetes` and `Route on OpenShift`, it does not work when a customer use `Ingress on OpenShift`.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Get a OpenShift cluster.
2. Install and run the operator using `make install run`
3. Deploy the Argo CD instance using below example.
```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
  labels:
    example: ingress
spec:
  server:
    ingress:
      enabled: true
    insecure: true
``` 
4. Wait for the operator to reconcile and create the pods.
5. Wait for the pods to move into running state.
6. Describe or Edit the Argo CD instance to identify that `.status` does not have any `host` field.

**Expected behavior**
host details should be updated in the Argo CD CR `.status`.

**Additional context**
As per my initial analysis, I have noticed that operator adds a Ingress Class annotation that is specific to `Nginx Ingress Controller`. By default the Ingress controller deployed in the OpenShift clusters is `HAProxy`, so the annotation hard coded [here](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/f67e04db076c8700260e100721391e8bfb570da3/controllers/argocd/ingress.go#L33) should be removed. 

One of the below conditions has to be met for the HA Proxy Ingress controller to read any Ingress resource
https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/docs/configuration/keys/#class-matter

A user has to be provided with an option to define their own Ingress class through the Argo CD CR.

Hi @Vikaspogu , This is actually fixed. I will close this with details.

Thanks for your interest in contributing. Please take a look at good-first-time labelled issues.
Use this example to fix this issue.

```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
  labels:
    example: ingress
spec:
  server:
    host: example-argocd-<yourcluster.example.com>
    grpc:
      ingress:
        enabled: true
    ingress:
      enabled: true
    insecure: true
```
