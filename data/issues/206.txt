The installation fails due to rate limits on Docker Hub:

It would be great to provide an alternate location of the container images.
@ctron This is really an issue with the upstream images
I see … I will raise an issue there …

However, I think the operator could be more open to accepting other versions. It looked like it pulled a specific sha. I wasn't able to re-upload the image to another container repository, as that changed the shasum.
You can override the images in the `ArgoCD` CR, and we're working on being able to configure this through OLM too.

I was trying to do this, but it didn't work. It continued to pull the specific sha256 images
Can you share an excerpt from the CR?
two days ago i had got similar problem, tomorrow i'll try to recover some logs or try to another installation. We tried to use another image but operator  put a sort of override inside at the deployment, with image tag version and sha
It looks like all the default images pull from quay now and I believe the ability to specify images for each component is also in place. Can this be closed?
