User-define imagePullPolicy
When deploying on certain types of clusters, i.e. bandwidth limited edge clusters, it's preferable to not pull images unless absolutely necessary.

It would be great to be able to define a global `imagePullPolicy` for the operator that all ArgoCD instances and their component services respect.

It would also be suitable, though tedious, to be able to pass this config along in the various component config sections of an ArgoCD object (e.g. controller.`imagePullPolicy`, `dex.imagePullPolicy`, etc.)

For context, here's what I'm seeing as "actual" `imagePullPolicy` of or various components:
argocd-application-controller                    Always
argocd-dex-server-xxx                      Always
argocd-operator-xxx                       Always
argocd-redis-ha-haproxy-xxx               IfNotPresent
argocd-redis-ha-server                           IfNotPresent,IfNotPresent 
argocd-repo-server-xxx                    Always
argocd-server-xxx                          Always
Would be fantastic if the default for all of these were set to IfNotPresent
