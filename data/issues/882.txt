ConfigMap `argocd-cm` is automatically overwritten
**Describe the bug**
A lot of the official documentation and other resources refer to editing the `argocd-cm` directly.
In later versions of the operator manual edits to the configmap will be overwritten.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Deploy the argocd-operator, i.e. the OpenShift Gitops Operator
2. Configure an `ArgoCD` resource
3. Edit the `argocd-cm` configmap, add e.g. `data:\n  accounts.deployer: apiKey`
4. Output the configmap and see that the change has been reverted

**Expected behavior**
That the configmap was left unchanged, or that official documentation refered to the new way of configuring the configmap.

Refering to https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/releases an `extraConfig` configuration option was added in `argocd-operator-0.4.0`.

There is however no reference to this in https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/argocd/.
This has been raised in in #858

* https://medium.com/@Tal-Hason/having-issues-updating-argocd-cm-with-openshift-gitops-caa5a0c4653e

Example usage:

```yaml
# kubectl edit argocd
spec:
  extraConfig:
    accounts.deployer: apiKey
```

Closing this issue as resolved, as there **is** a fix for this issue regarding the `argocd-cm` configmap being overwritten, and that the documentation issue is / should be followed up in issue 858.
