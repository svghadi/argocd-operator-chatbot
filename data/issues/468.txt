Add support for ArgoCD server `--rootpath` parameter
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The ui being a single page app, I can't place the service behind an url with a different rootpath other than `/`.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The server block should allow additional command parameters  
and merge them with the default when creating the Deployment resource.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Having a specific entry `rootpath` would also work, but limits flexibility.

**Additional context**

Hi @13013SwagR , Can you please provide more details regarding your request and use-case ? Thanks !!
Sure,
**Context**
I am given an URL to access my instance as it runs in a segregated sub-net
e.g. `internal.domain.net/proxied_path/`  

**Actual behavior**
I need to set the `rootpath` to `proxied_path` because when ArgoCD loads, 
it updates the URL to `internal.domain.net/Application`
_This is a common problem with single page apps_  

**Desired behavior**
I need ArgoCD to be aware of the `rootpath` so its loads the URL like `internal.domain.net/proxied_path/Application`
Are u using route or an ingress. 

I think your problem should be solved by adding the path to your server spec in the Argo CD CR. Something like this.
```
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
  labels:
    example: route
spec:
  server:
    route:
      enabled: true
      path: <something>/applications
```

I am using a route
I tried your solution, but without success
The path is present in the ArgoCD CR, but not in the route or the deployment.
if it is not working then its a bug. Let me give it a try and see what is going on :)
