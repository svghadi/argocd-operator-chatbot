ApplicationSet controller not mounting ArgoCD secrets to access repositories through SSH
**Describe the bug**
ApplicationSet controller is not mounting the ArgoCD repositories SSH keys to clone the repo for a given Git Generator configuration.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Deploy an ArgoCD instance with the latest ArgoCD operator.
2. Add the ApplicationSet controller by adding the required configuration: `spec. applicationSet: {}`.
3. Deploy an ApplicationSet pointing to the same repo as an ArgoCD Application CRD definition, as described in [this issue of the ArgoCD repo](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/issues/163).
4. The ApplicationSet controller will report an error indicating that it cannot download the repo.

```

**Expected behavior**
The ArgoCD operator should create the ApplicationSet controller and mount the required secrets, as it was implemented in [this issue](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/pull/164) for the ApplicationSet controller.


**Additional context**
I noticed the fix in the ArgoCD repo was submitted around 19 days after the inclusion of the feature in the operator.
* [Add support for Argo CD ApplicationSet controller installation, March 3rd](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/pull/252)
* [ApplicationSet does not support private repos configured using SSH, March 22](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/pull/164)

Let me know if you need more information.

Thank you!

@jgwest I would like to start with this. This should be a good start to gain some understanding on Application Sets as well. 
@iam-veeramalla thanks for volunteering! Fortunately, I've actually got a fix on a local branch already which I worked on last week... opened the PR for it here: https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/pull/291

@jgwest was about to raise a PR for the same :p .. Always a next time :) 
@iam-veeramalla Ah, sorry, I had hoped that you hadn't started working on it yet :frowning_face:, you're just too quick :smile:. 
As a workaround for folks that hit this issue:
- You can use a https url, rather than an SSH URL, which avoids the issue.
- You can use [personal access token](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/private-repositories/#access-token) rather than an SSH key to connect to the repository, which avoids the issue.
My current solution was to install the AppSet controller separately with the YAMLs provided by [the original project](https://argocd-applicationset.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Geting-Started/), since it already has the fix applied, and it has worked nicely so far. Glad you already committed the changes, thanks @jgwest .
