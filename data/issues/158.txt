 How to Disable Admin User
I see that you can edit the ArgoCD Config Map in a manual install to disable the operator, but don't see an option you can include in the "kind: ArgoCD" spec to do so with the OLM managed install. 

Manual:
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
  namespace: argocd
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-cm
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: argocd
data:
  **admin.enabled: "false"**
Hi @jdziedzic, the operator does not support this directly but you should be able to use the approach from the Argo CD docs like you mentioned.

https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/user-management/#disable-admin-user

You have a couple of options. You could either add that key/value to the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap after the operator creates it or you could create the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap before you create your ArgoCD custom resource and the operator will update the rest of the properties once it deploys the cluster.

I do think this is a good feature to add to the operator and will open a PR to add the ability to do this directly from the ArgoCD custom resource.
I think this has been implemented by #184. Closing issue.
