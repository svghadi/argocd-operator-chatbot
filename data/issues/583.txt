Add "helm.valuesFileSchemes" for argocd-cm for usage of helm-secrets
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
This Featurerequest is related to a problem, because of a change since ArgoCD 2.2.6, it is neccessary to configure helm.valuesFileSchemes in argocd-cm to be able to use helm-secrets with ArgoCD. See Issue: "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/8535"

Additionally see Documentation of helm-secrets: "https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets/wiki/ArgoCD-Integration#option-2-init-container"

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A first solution for this could be, so simply add a configuration option to the CRD to configure "helm.valuesFileSchemes". 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
However, wouldn't it be much easier, to allow configuration of argocd-cm configmap directly? This would may be the alternative for a longer period in time.

**Additional context**
Don't think there are screenshot necessary. 
Hi @romulus-ai , Sorry for getting back late on this one.

We are discussing internally about allowing the users to update the configmap(argocd-cm). I will update this issue accordingly. 
will be fixed as part of #641
