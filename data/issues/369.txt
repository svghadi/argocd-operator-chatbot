How to control securityContext

I have k8s cluster with installed pod security policy.

My cluster setup for operator 0.15 and argocd 2.0.4

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd-1
spec:
  image: quay.io/argoproj/argocd
  version: v2.0.4 
  redis:
    image: redis
    version: 6.2.4-alpine  
  dex: 
    image: quay.io/dexidp/dex
    version: sha256:01e996b4b60edcc5cc042227c6965dd63ba68764c25d86b481b0d65f6e4da308
  ha:
    enabled: false
    redisProxyImage: haproxy
    redisProxyVersion: "2.0.4"
```
In CRD there should be a possibility to run redis image as non root. 

How to control securityContext ?
The same here I have with haproxy image in ha setup.


This same problem exists for quite a few configurables required for modifying argocd for [argocd-vault-integration](https://argocd-vault-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/).

You can't set security context, mountSAtoken doesn't work, serviceAccountName doesn't work.
