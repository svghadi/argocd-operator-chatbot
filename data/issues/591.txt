Add SECURITY.md
The Argo maintainers recently agreed to require all Argoproj Labs project repositories to contain a `SECURITY.md` file which documents:
* Contact information for reporting security vulnerabilities
* Some minimal information about policies, practices, with possibly links to further documentation with more details

This will help direct vulnerability reporting to the right parties which can fix the issue.

You are free to use the following as examples/templates:
* [Argoproj](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
* [Workflows](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
* [CD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/SECURITY.md)

Also, please note that in the future we are exploring a requirement that argoproj-labs projects perform a [CII self-assessment](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en) to better inform its users about which security best practices are being followed.
