Hi @srekkas ,

I am also wondering if I should upgrade from 0.7.0 to 0.8.0 in production... There are no release notes available and git issues in this project that get created lately do not get answered or taken. :/

I did the upgrade in my staging environment(`4.14.0-0.okd-2023-11-14-101924`) and that looks to work ok... but my `kind: Subscription` on argocd-operator gives the following message which makes me reluctant to upgrade production...

```
- message: 'constraints not satisfiable: @existing/openshift-operators//argocd-operator.v0.7.0
      and @existing/openshift-operators//argocd-operator.v0.8.0 provide ArgoCDExport
      (argoproj.io/v1alpha1), clusterserviceversion argocd-operator.v0.7.0 exists
      and is not referenced by a subscription, subscription argocd-operator exists,
      subscription argocd-operator requires @existing/openshift-operators//argocd-operator.v0.8.0'
    reason: ConstraintsNotSatisfiable
    status: "True"
    type: ResolutionFailed

```

Which version of OKD4.14 are you running? `DeploymentConfigs` are deprecated since OKD4.14(which uses `apps.openshift.io/v1`)... but it should not have been removed yet?





@jonasbartho I use same 4.14.0-0.okd-2023-11-14-101924.
It works on 4.13.0-0.okd-2023-09-30-084937




Hmm,

Do you get an output when running `oc api-resources | grep -i deploymentconfig`? 

The output should be:
```
deploymentconfigs  dc  apps.openshift.io/v1  true    DeploymentConfig
```
Output empty, it is fresh installation ...

4.14
oc api-resources | grep -i deploymentconfig

4.13
oc api-resources | grep -i deploymentconfig
deploymentconfigs                     dc                                   apps.openshift.io/v1                          true         DeploymentConfig


OK, thanks, my cluster missing "DeploymentConfig" capability ...

Just want to mention that DeploymentConfigs are deprecated starting with OpenShift 4.14, so it would be great if the controller-manager would also start if DeploymentConfigs are not available
