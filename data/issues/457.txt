Example for grafana does not work
**Describe the bug**
The example available for Argo CD with grafana does not seem to work. Operator is running into the error state.
Example:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/master/examples/argocd-route.yaml
```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
  labels:
    example: route
spec:
  grafana:
    enabled: true
    route:
      enabled: true
  prometheus:
    enabled: true
    route:
      enabled: true
  server:
    route:
      enabled: true
```

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1.  Install the operator from Operator Hub or `make run`.
2.  Create Argo CD Instance with grafana and openshift route as mentioned above.
3.  Verify that the Argo CD workloads are not created and operator throws the below error.

**Expected behavior**
No error.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

I am experiencing this issue as well. After looking at it, it seems the error comes from [this line](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/master/controllers/argocd/grafana.go#L135). I cannot find anything that would create the `/var/lib/grafana/templates` directory or populate any `.tmpl` files. I looked through the git blame and it doesn't look like anything has changed since the code was introduced.

Is there a missing configuration option?
If u start Prometheus Operator in local-machine (not container) - need to copy files from directory `grafana` to `/var/lib/grafana` like it's do in [DockerFile](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/master/Dockerfile).

Or use environment variable `GRAFANA_CONFIG_PATH` to change dir path from `/var/lib/grafana` to `<PROJECT_PATH>/grafana`

Of change `ArgoCDDefaultGrafanaConfigPath` in `common/defaults`
