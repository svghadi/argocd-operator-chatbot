ArgoCDExport with existing PVC is not using the correct name field
**Describe the bug**
I tried to connect ArgoCDExport to an existing PVC which is allocated using CSI driver (using the `dataSource` fields). When going through the source code of the operator I found out that the claim name to be used is the ArgoCDExport name and not the name field under `dataSource`

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a PVC.
2. Create a ArgoCDExport with the corresponding name and kind under `dataSource` and set the `backend` field to local
3. The created CronJob template is mounting EmptyDir instead of the existing PVC.

**Expected behavior**
being able to create existing PVC and ArgoCDExport with different names while specifing the correct PVC name.
Hi @momoadc , Thanks a lot for raising issue with us :)

You mentioned that you have already looked into the code which is doing wrong, do you want to contribute this to us ? Thanks :)

Do you want to raise a PR with the changes ?
From what i have seen the field `dataSource` is not integrated with ArgoCDExport yet (it is not used at all). the fix requires more then changing the line.
