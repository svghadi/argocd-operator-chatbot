Update operator to use ArgoCD version 1.8.x
With many recent changes in version 1.8.x, the ArgoCD operator might need to be updated to use ArgoCD version 1.8.x.

Should we change this to point to the latest when the user doesn't worry to specify `cr.Spec.Image` and `cr.Spec.Version`. 

https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/53da9a9e5d3554eae98dc652f9b8270834ed5a42/pkg/common/defaults.go#L46


The [Deployment that's created for the controller](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/9e257ece79533368c168f7a4b6648e9567171028/pkg/controller/argocd/deployment.go#L295) should be converted to a StatefulSet https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/upgrading/1.7-1.8/

The old Deployment should be deleted, and we need to test the upgrade.
Operator now supports Argo 2.X and the application-controller has been converted to use a statefulset (https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/master/controllers/argocd/statefulset.go). So I think this can be closed?
Per @tylerauerbeck's comment, closing this issue. Thanks.
