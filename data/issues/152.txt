OLM version mismatch/initialSSHKnownHosts validation error
Hello! Looks like OLM CatalogSource still holds 0.12 hash, after replacing it to `sha256:5c5aae9e6fae7ec03b92185389178fd20749a47f881ed520a24492ee347d4a77` I was able to install 0.13 operator, but it looks like 0.13 feature with inclusion of default ssh hosts won't work
Adding this to ArgoCD yaml:
```
  initialSSHKnownHosts:
    excludedefaulthosts: false
    keys: |
      gitlab.e-queo.xyz ssh-ed25519 AAAAC...
```
Produces validation error on apply - 

> The ArgoCD "argocd-main" is invalid: spec.initialSSHKnownHosts: Invalid value: "object": spec.initialSSHKnownHosts in body must be of type string: "object"
Going to look into this @Unb9rn.

As a side note, the 0.0.13 version should show up in the Operator Hub soon, as the PRs have been submitted to upgrade to v0.0.13.
Same problem here. Deploying the Operator with this yaml file on OpenShift v4.5.9:
```yaml
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: argocd-operator
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  channel: alpha
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: argocd-operator
  source: community-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  startingCSV: argocd-operator.v0.0.13
```
Generates this CRD:
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: argocds.argoproj.io
spec:
  versions:
  - name: v1alpha1
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        properties:
          spec:
            properties:
...
              initialSSHKnownHosts:
                description: InitialSSHKnownHosts defines the SSH known hosts data
                  upon creation of the cluster for connecting Git repositories via
                  SSH.
                type: string
...
```
While the application expects a map since https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/pull/134.
Why did the operator installed from scratch with v0.0.13 deployed the CRD of v0.0.12?
BTW, why did you do incompatible changes in the CRD definition without increasing its version to `v1alpha2`?
The CRD for the OLM catalog still refers to the old version of the CRD : https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/8c2aae890864a975031f4aa7dd5aa4c4c9d17a73/deploy/olm-catalog/argocd-operator/0.0.13/argoproj.io_argocds_crd.yaml#L341-L344
I guess this is why we retrieve the old CRD when using OLM.
I just faced the same issue... Is there any work in progress or possibility to have it fixed in next release?
Hi @dsanchor, yes working on the next release (v0.0.14) right now that will include the fix for this issue.
