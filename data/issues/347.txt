ArgoCDExport wrong service account names
I have an argocd-operator that was manually deployed using your documentation [here](https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/manual/). Now, I want to store backups in the AWS S3 bucket, for this purpose, I use your documentation [here](https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/export/#aws). 

However, I have some troubles with that, here is an example of an error that I have:

Accounts that I have in the `argocd-operator` namespace:

Backup configuration file:

Can you, please, advise, what I should do with that?

I have the same problem, but with a different setup. I have a namespace called argocd-operator, where the argocd-operator pod is deployed. In this namespace a service-account argocd-application-controller exists.

The argocd and argocdexport resources have been created in the argocd namespace. Therefore, all argocd pods are launched in the argocd namespace.

The job that is created automatically for the argocdexport runs into the same issue that has been described by @EugeneLugovtsov .

If I create the argocdexport resource in the argocd-operator namespace the service-account is found, but the pod launched by the export job runs in to the following issue: configmaps \"argocd-cm\" not found"

The only way I found to solve the issue is to have the argocd-operator and the argocd application in the same namespace. If that is true, then the argocd export job works like a charm.

Thanks for the feedback !!
This is fixed in the latest version of the operator. Specifically by the PR #507.
