Unify SSO configuration in Argo CD CR
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently, argocd-operator supports both dex and keycloak SSO providers, but the process to configure both of them differs and there's no intuitive, standard way to configure and switch between them. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
we should move `dex` configuration from `spec.dex` to `spec.sso` to align it with keycloak. This would allow us to have a more consistent user experience installing the different sso providers supported today and also make it extensible to other potential providers in the future
