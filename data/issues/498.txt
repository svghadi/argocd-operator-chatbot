Publish latest operator build to quay workflow is failing.
**Describe the bug**
It appears that the workflow that publishes the latest operator build to quay has been failing. From looking at the latest push to `master`, the logs suggest that it's because it isn't using the appropriate credentials to talk to quay.

```
Run make docker-push
docker push ***/argocd-operator:latest
The push refers to repository [***/argocd-operator]
29b337577a2a: Preparing
9cfd2c8d9aea: Preparing
636092609a0e: Preparing
6d75f23be3dd: Preparing
unauthorized: access to the requested resource is not authorized
make: *** [Makefile:105: docker-push] Error 1
Error: Process completed with exit code 2.
```

Earlier in the workflow it should authenticate against the docker repository with the following secrets:

```
      - name: Login to Registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          registry: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_URL }}
          username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
```

This is likely because of one of the following:
- These are not the appropriate secret names that we should be using
- They are the appropriate secret names, but don't have the expected values.

**To Reproduce**
Verify that the last push to `master` had a failed workflow
On any subsequent pushes to `master`, this workflow will continue to fail


**Expected behavior**
Each time a push to master occurs, the latest version of the operator should be pushed to the `latest` tag on quay.

We need to fix this on priority. Its been a quite a good time we are seeing this issue.
@iam-veeramalla Agreed. Happy to help out where/if I can. Feel free to reach out as I'm the one who implemented the workflow I believe. Just don't have any visibility to what those values are on the backend (my suspicion is that the creds are probably fine and it's more around `REGISTRY_URL` not being configured as expected).

Thanks @tylerauerbeck , I will take a look at it asap.
@iam-veeramalla No problem. For reference, the PR that merged this in is here: https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/pull/365

If you look at the notes it expects REGISTRY_URL to be quay.io/argocd-operator. So if the secret isn't set to that, then we can just make a small change to the workflow to utilize some other envvar's that are available in GHA to piece together the appropriate URL.
