ApplicationSet controller Deployment reconcilliation update logic misses volume field
**Describe the bug**
The ApplicationSet controller Deployment reconciliation logic works well on Create, but on update it fails to include the Volumes, causing an error in the logs like:
`
Deployment.apps \"applicationset-controller\" is invalid: [spec.template.spec.containers[0].volumeMounts[0].name: Not found: \"ssh-known-hosts\", spec.template.spec.containers[0].volumeMounts[1].name: Not found: \"tls-certs\", spec.template.spec.containers[0].volumeMounts[2].name: Not found: \"gpg-keys\", spec.template.spec.containers[0].volumeMounts[3].name: Not found: \"gpg-keyring\", spec.template.spec.containers[0].volumeMounts[4].name: Not found: \"argocd-repo-server-tls\"]"
`
In this case, the podspec containers volumemounts is correctly updated in the Deployment, but the `volumes` field of the Deployment is not, causing the above error.

This was reproduced in the upgrade scenario, where the old version of the ApplicationSet deployment would be missing these fields, causing the update logic to be invoked, and incorrectly doing a partial update of the Deployment (causing the above error).
