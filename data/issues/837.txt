server rolebinding does not have access to applicationset resource
**Describe the bug**
If `spec.applicationSet` is enabled, the operator does not reconcile the server RoleBinding to manage `ApplicationSet`s.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a basic cluster with `applicationset-controller` enabled:
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  applicationSet: {}
```
```sh
$ kubectl apply -n argocd -f example.yaml
```
2. Login into the CLI (in this case, with port-forward):
```sh
$ kubectl port-forward -n argocd services/example-server 8080:443 &>/dev/null &
$ argocd login localhost:8080 --insecure
```
3. List applicationsets (for example):
```sh
$ argocd appset list
```
**Expected behavior**
A list containing the installed applicationsets should display, instead the following error appears:

```
FATA[0000] rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = error listing ApplicationSets with selectors: applicationsets.argoproj.io is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:argocd:example-argocd-server" cannot list resource "applicationsets" in API group "argoproj.io" in the namespace "argocd"
```

**Additional information**
Operator version: v0.5.0 (`2f5c0d456760`)
Hi @cgrs , can you tell me which version of the operator are you using ?
