Avoid use of Routes in the ArgoCD API
Generally speaking, wondering if any API field which is applicable only to a specific Kubernetes distribution ( in this case OpenShift ) should be a part of the strongly typed API ?

Given that this is an upstream Kubernetes operator and the `Route` API  is a vendor-specific Ingress implementation, should we consider moving it out of the strongly typed API ?

One of the ways to handle this without a lot of fuss is to support vendor specific intentions as annotations. There could be better ways to do so for sure. 

I'll try going over similar scenarios in other projects and see if we can inherit a practice based on precedence :)
