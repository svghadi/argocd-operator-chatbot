resourceHealthChecks for APIs with no Group is generated incorrectly
**Describe the bug**

Defining a health check with resourceHealthChecks for APIs like PersistentVolumeClaim just has a Kind and no group results in the following being generated in argocd-cm which does not work:
```
  resource.customizations.health._PersistentVolumeClaim: |
```
I think however this needs to be generated as follows without the underscore:
```
  resource.customizations.health.PersistentVolumeClaim: |
```

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. In the Argo CD Spec define a resourceHealthCheck for an object with no group, for example:

```
  resourceHealthChecks:
    - kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
      check: |
        hs = {}
        if obj.status ~= nil then
          if obj.status.phase ~= nil then
            if obj.status.phase == "Pending" then
              hs.status = "Healthy"
              hs.message = obj.status.phase
              return hs
            end
            if obj.status.phase == "Bound" then
              hs.status = "Healthy"
              hs.message = obj.status.phase
              return hs
            end
          end
        end
        hs.status = "Progressing"
        hs.message = "Waiting for PVC"
        return hs
```
**Expected behavior**

The generated value in argocd-cm should not include the prefix underscore.
