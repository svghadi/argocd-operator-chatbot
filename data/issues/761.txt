Keycloak/RHSSO login yields in certificate signed by unknown authority
**Describe the bug**
Argo CD Operator can make use of RHSSO & KeyCloak through OIDC in addition to Dex. However, with a recent security fix applied, the certificate of RHSSO  or Keycloak cannot be validated in some scenarios. 

Single Sign On with Argo CD Operator can fail with the error message "x509: certificate signed by unknown authority" under the following circumstances:
```
    You are using RHSSO or KeyCloak as SSO provider and
    You are using a self-signed certificate for your route endpoints, or you are using a private CA to issue certificates
```

This behavior is a result of a [security fix](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-7943-82jg-wmw5) in Argo CD, which enforces a strict validation of TLS certificates on the configued OIDC endpoints.
