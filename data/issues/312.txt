Automatically install and configure Keycloak SSO for ArgoCD instance
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
As an admin, I want to enable KeyCloak on my Argo CD instance by add the following stanza in the CR.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD

spec:
  sso:
    provider: keycloak
```
Argocd operator should create all configurations necessary to enable SSO for my instance.

As an admin, I want to disable KeyCloak SSO by removing sso provider in my CR.  All keycloak configurations and resources should be removed from cluster.
