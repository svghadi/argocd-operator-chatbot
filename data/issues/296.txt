Syncronize an application when creating it
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The typical workflow I follow when deploying apps in ArgoCD is first to create the app, and then syncronize it so that ArgoCD starts working. Without using the operator I would do something as:
```
$ argocd app create guestbook --repo https://github.com/kubernetes/examples.git --path guestbook/all-in-one --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace argocd

$ argocd app sync guestbook
```
In order to implement this behavior making use of the `ArgoCD` CR object I do:
```
- apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Application
  metadata:
    name: guestbook
    namespace: ${OPERATOR_NAMESPACE}
  spec:
    destination:
      namespace: ${OPERATOR_NAMESPACE}
      server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
    project: default
    source:
      path: guestbook
      targetRevision: HEAD
      repoURL: 'https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git'
    syncPolicy:
      automated: {}
```
After executing it the CR `Application` gets generated but not synchronized, so the pods, services ... are not created.
I have followed the **Sync** chapter from the documentation https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/auto_sync/
But it does not work.

```
[hesteban-redhat.com@bastion argo]$ oc process -f deploy-app.yaml | oc apply -f -
application.argoproj.io/guestbook created
```
It creates the app but does not launch it. Then I need to manually login to `ArgoCD` and execute the `sync`:

```
$ argocd  app sync guestbook

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I want to be able to do what I manually do by just using objects from the operator
**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Do it manually but it does not work according to customer specifications
