Prepare Operator so that is can be installed in Disconnected Environment
This documents describes partially that Images used by the Operator should be made configurable so that the Operator can be installed in a Disconnected Environments https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/contributors/design-proposals/related-images.md

all images used by the operator should be made configurable via env variables and be referenced via SHAs
I am planning to start work on this soon, as the operator should support air-gapped installs where an internet connection is unavailable. The images used by the operator should use the SHA tags instead of standard version tags.
I'm evaluating Argo for air gapped envs, so this feature would be a game changer
Released as part of v0.0.5.
