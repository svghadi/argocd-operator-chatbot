Error updating docs. 
**Describe the bug**
CI builds on readthedocs are failing from past few weeks with the below error
```
[33mWARNING  -  [0mConfig value: 'site_url'. Warning: This option is now required. Set to a valid URL or an empty string to avoid an error in a future release.
[33mWARNING  -  [0mConfig value: 'site_url'. Warning: The 'use_directory_urls' option has been disabled because 'site_url' contains an empty value. Either define a valid URL for 'site_url' or set 'use_directory_urls' to False.
