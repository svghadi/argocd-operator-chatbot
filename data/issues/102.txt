Add support for Workload Identity authentication in GCP
Hello ArgoCD team, I have been recently using ArgoCD and I think it's awesome, now I am deploying the operator in PoC clusters and soon I hope in prod ones.

I wanted to raise the idea of adding support for [GCP's Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/introducing-workload-identity-better-authentication-for-your-gke-applications) to the `ArgoCDExporter` component, since I believe it simplifies the authentication process of applications running in GKE. I noticed that `ArgoCDExporter` already supports authentication through a [service account key provided as a secret](https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/export/#gcp-secrets), which is awesome, and I think, a great fit to also enable Workload Identity.

**TL;DR; for Workload Identity**: It allows to access GCP APIs by linking a K8s Service Account (SA) with a GCP one, in that way, K8s now knows how o authenticate with GCP APIs, keys are automatically rotated and no more secrets need to be provided to the workloads with SA Keys.

I am willing to add the support myself, but I am quite new to Operators. I can give it a try though.

On a side note, I also noticed that the contributing guidelines linked in the issue are pointing to the wrong URL, it should be:

* https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/master/docs/contribute/development.md

And it points to:

* https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

As for my use case, I can use the current secret implementation, but it'd be awesome to be able to use a `serviceAccount` in addition to the `secretName` available (since there may be use cases where Workload Identity does not satisfy the requirements due to [limitations](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity#limitations)).

As for the [GCP IAM configuration section](https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/export/#gcp-iam-configuration), I already have a working Terraform template that sets up a bucket, as well as a service account and permissions. Not sure if that could be useful on defining that section of the docs.

Please let me know if you need further information, and how we could move forward with this.

Thank you!

Hello @LaloLoop, I just wanted to start by thanking you for trying out the operator.

I will fix the links you mentioned and I need to add a bit more to the development docs as well.

A PR would be great if you would like to submit one, or we can collaborate a bit on it, whichever you prefer. I think the enhancement that you propose is a good addition. I will admit that I am much more familiar with AWS over GCP so your experience there would be helpful in both documentation around that as well as the implementation in the operator.

Finally, if you have any feedback over the export process in general, that would be helpful. For example, I am looking to move away from the util image for the export job and handle it a bit different. That util image is based on the argocd image and is quite large.
Thank you for the quick reply, @jmckind . It'd be awesome if we can collaborate on it, I will begin by setting up my dev environment following the development guide and start looking into the code, I can make some time in the upcoming days to submit a PR. I will also check the docs to see if I can add the _GCP IAM configuration_ section.
Later I can have a look into the exporter and discuss the ideas you've got for it.
Greetings!
