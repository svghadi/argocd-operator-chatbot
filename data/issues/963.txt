ArgoCD Operator image 0.7.0 available before the actual release
**Describe the bug**

Despite the latest version of the operator being [0.6.0](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/releases/tag/v0.6.0), the docker image for 0.7.0 is already available (I assume by mistake).
I got notified because we have [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) automation creating PRs for new versions of docker images of the components we use.

The docker image should be removed to avoid others using it before the actual release.

**To Reproduce**
- Visit https://quay.io/repository/argoprojlabs/argocd-operator?tab=tags&tag=latest
- Observe the `v0.7.0` tag available despite the release not happened yet
- Run `docker pull quay.io/argoprojlabs/argocd-operator:v0.7.0` to ensure the image is indeed publicly accessible.

**Expected behavior**
The docker image `quay.io/argoprojlabs/argocd-operator:v0.7.0` should be removed from the registry.
