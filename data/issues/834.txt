Hi @susmitaganguli , You are using a different image `quay.io/redhat-cop/dex`. Why ?

The problem should be with that image.
Hi @iam-veeramalla,
The operator comes with this image. 
What is the correct image to use for the argocd-dex-server?

Thanks,
Susmita
@susmitaganguli No, this is the default Image.
https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/821311a9ed597d7e9aaedcd6790e5baa61379db9/common/defaults.go#L98

Please check if you are overriding the default Image using the CR
@iam-veeramalla - Thank you ! Problem has been fixed. 
Unfortunately, I could not authenticate with ghcr.io. Instead pulled the same image from docker.io.
