Probes failure results in RH-SSO pod crash
**Describe the bug**
The latest version of RH-SSO (rh-sso-76) pod crashes intermittently due to the liveness and readiness probes failure.

```
Readiness probe failed: {
    "probe.eap.dmr.EapProbe": "Error sending probe request: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)",
    "probe.eap.dmr.HealthCheckProbe": "Error sending probe request: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)"
}

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Enable keycloak as sso using `.spec.sso.provider: keycloak` in the Argo CD CR.
2. Wait for the keycloak pod to crash.

**Expected behavior**
Keycloak pod is up and running.

**Screenshots**
Error message provided above.

**Additional context**
This can probably be fixed by increasing the `initialdelayseconds` and `timeoutseconds`.
