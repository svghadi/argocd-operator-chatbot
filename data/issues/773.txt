Manage ArgoCD Image Updater lifecycle in the ArgoCD Operator
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When using the ArgoCD Operator, a lot of ArgoCD resources and their lifecycle can be managed by the Operator. Currently, the [ArgoCD Image Updater](https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable) resources need to be installed to the Kubernetes cluster manually. Mixing in a manual deployment process for some parts of the ArgoCD ecosystem gets hard to maintain and is unexpected from a user perspective. Changes in ArgoCD that require a re-configuration of the ArgoCD Image Updater resources will need to be resolved manually by the user, while the rest of the ArgoCD ecosystem is managed by the Operator.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Implement the lifecycle management of ArgoCD Image Updater resources by the ArgoCD Operator, in a similar way that is being offered for the [ApplicationSet Controller](https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/argocd/#applicationset-controller-options).

Hi @juv , we have this in our backlog list. I think we should get this done in the next release.

@iam-veeramalla sounds great, looking forward to using this in our Openshift ArgoCD Operator ðŸš€ 
Is there a public roadmap and eta for the next release by any chance?

I don't have the exact release date yet, we are targeting something around 1st or 2nd week of November. 
hi @juv 
as an update to this - we are currently hoping to get Image Updater merged into core Argo CD itself 
that would make this functionality available to argo-cd natively
