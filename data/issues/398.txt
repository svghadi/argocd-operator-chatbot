uid_entrypoint.sh renamed to entrypoint.sh, breaks using v2.1.0 
**Describe the bug**
```
argocd-repo-server-6dc987d959-q75xr   0/1     CreateContainerError
```
- because of hardcoded uid_entrypoint.sh which was renamed here

https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/entrypoint.sh

**To Reproduce**
install version 2.1.0 argocd
This has been fixed in v2.1.1 of Argo CD, there now is a symlink `uid_entrypoint.sh -> entrypoint.sh`. Since upstream operator issue is closed, can we close this as well? 
ah yes.
