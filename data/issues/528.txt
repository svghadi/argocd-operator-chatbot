Cant Build Catalog | Error: Binary was compiled with 'CGO_ENABLED=0', go-sqlite3 requires cgo to work. This is a stub
**Describe the bug**
On catalog build via 
```
make catalog-build 
```
error recieved 
```
Error: Binary was compiled with 'CGO_ENABLED=0', go-sqlite3 requires cgo to work. This is a stub
```
Dockerfile by default includes: 
```
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags="$LD_FLAGS" -a -o manager main.go
```
**To Reproduce**
build catalog on Mac  catalina 10.15.7  - make no changes to dockerfile 

**Expected behavior**
catalog builds correctly 

**Additional context**
I fulfil all requirements, i would think that goach of amd64 with go is compatible? 

go version go1.17.5 darwin/amd64
solved with opm v1.15.2.  not v1.15.1 in makefile
Thanks for that @EHSchmitt4395 , Do you want to raise a PR with fix version ?
