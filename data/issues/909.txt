`mkdocs serve` doesn't work
**Describe the bug**
When trying to verify some docs changes I made, I tried to run `mkdocs serve` but it gave me the error: 
```
$ mkdocs build
ERROR    -  Config value: 'theme'. Error: Unrecognised theme name: 'material'. The available installed themes are: mkdocs, readthedocs
Aborted with 1 Configuration Errors!
```

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. run `mkdocs serve`

**Expected behavior**
Should serve me my locally built docs in a webpage

**Additional context**
We should update our mkdocs theme to have it the same way argo-cd does it: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/mkdocs.yml
