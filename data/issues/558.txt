Changing host does not update ingress
**Describe the bug**
When setting up an `ArgoCd`, and later changing the host the ingress will not be updated with the new host information.

**To Reproduce**
Do a kubectl apply on something like:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd
spec:
  server:
    ingress:
      enabled: true
```

followed by a kubectl apply on something like:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd
spec:
  server:
    host: foo.bar

    ingress:
      enabled: true
```

then the host will still be set to the default value when describing the ingress

**Expected behavior**
That the ingress will be updated with the new host
Is there any news on this please? Its a bit counter intuitive to have an operator but its still needed to alter the ingress directly after installation.
