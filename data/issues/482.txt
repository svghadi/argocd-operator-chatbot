The new version of the operator v.0.1.0 installs ArgoCD in Namespaced mode. (OLM)
Previously on 0.0.15, the installation wasn't namespaced I believe, it was restricted through the CRB to only manipulate resources within the namespace of argo but it wasn't a namespaced installation. The problem we have now is installing CRDs or any cluster level resources isn't working with 0.1.0. 

Is there an option to disable namespaced installation?

Example of what happens:

Hey, there is actually a way to elevate certain instances to be operating in cluster-scoped mode. You need to edit the `Subscription` resource to add the environment variable `ARGOCD_CLUSTER_CONFIG_NAMESPACES` to include the namespace where you installed the `ArgoCD` operand to, e.g.

```
config:
  env:
  - name: ARGOCD_CLUSTER_CONFIG_NAMESPACES
    value: namespace1
```
This can also take a comma-separated list of multiple namespaces, when you have more than one Argo CD that should receive cluster level privileges.

We have some docs debt here, please bear with us.
@jannfis , this actually solves the problem, thank you so much :)
